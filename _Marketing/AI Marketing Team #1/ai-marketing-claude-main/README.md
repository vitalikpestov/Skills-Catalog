## Scoring Methodology

The full marketing audit scores websites across 6 dimensions:

| Category | Weight | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Content & Messaging | 25% | Copy quality, value props, headlines, CTAs |
| Conversion Optimization | 20% | Funnels, forms, social proof, friction, urgency |
| SEO & Discoverability | 20% | On-page SEO, technical SEO, content structure |
| Competitive Positioning | 15% | Differentiation, market awareness, alternatives |
| Brand & Trust | 10% | Design quality, trust signals, authority |
| Growth & Strategy | 10% | Pricing, acquisition channels, retention |

**Overall Marketing Score** = Weighted average of all categories (0-100)

---

## How It Works

1. **You type a command** — e.g., `/market audit https://example.com`
2. **Claude reads the skill files** — they tell Claude exactly how to analyze the site
3. **5 subagents launch in parallel** — each one analyzes a different dimension
4. **Python scripts run** — automated page analysis, competitor scanning
5. **Results are compiled** — into a scored, prioritized, actionable report
6. **Output is saved** — as a Markdown file or professional PDF

---

## Use Cases
