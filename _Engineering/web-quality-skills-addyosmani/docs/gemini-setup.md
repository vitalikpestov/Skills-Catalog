# Using web-quality-skills with Gemini CLI

This repository is also a [Gemini CLI extension](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions/). The same `skills/` directory used by Claude Code is consumed by Gemini — no files are copied or duplicated.

## Install (one command)

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/addyosmani/web-quality-skills
```

Make sure you have installed the [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/).

Gemini clones the repo into `~/.gemini/extensions/web-quality-skills/`, registers the extension, and auto-discovers the bundled skills. Restart Gemini CLI if it's already running.

Local clones work too:

```bash
gemini extensions install /path/to/your/clone
```

## Usage

After install, the model activates a skill automatically when your prompt matches its description. All 6 skills under `skills/` are available:

- `web-quality-audit`
- `performance`
- `core-web-vitals`
- `accessibility`
- `seo`
- `best-practices`

Try prompts like _"audit my site for web quality issues"_, _"speed up this page"_, or _"WCAG audit"_ and Gemini will pick the right skill.

## How it works

- `gemini-extension.json` — extension manifest at the repo root. Gemini CLI requires this to recognize the directory as an extension.
- `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — unchanged. Gemini CLI auto-discovers any `skills/` directory bundled with an extension. Frontmatter uses the same `name` + `description` format Claude Code expects, so one file serves both platforms.
- `.gemini/skills` — git-tracked symlink to `../skills` (mode `120000`). Lets Gemini load the same skills as **workspace skills** when you run Gemini CLI inside a clone of this repo, without going through `gemini extensions install`.

## Workspace mode (running from a clone)

If you've cloned the repo and want the skills active in just that working directory — without globally installing the extension — Gemini CLI auto-loads any skills it finds under `.gemini/skills/`. The symlink in this repo wires that up out of the box: launch Gemini CLI from the repo root and the 6 skills become available for that session.

## No symlinks (Windows or personal preference)

If symlinks don't work on your machine, replace the symlink with a real copy of the skills inside `.gemini/`. Run this from the repo root after cloning:

```bash
rm .gemini/skills
cp -R skills .gemini/skills
```

This is a **local-only** change — don't commit it. The upstream repo keeps the symlink so workspace mode stays a one-clone affair for everyone else.
