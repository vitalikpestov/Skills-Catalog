# Runtime Data Inventory

Use this file to decide what the agent can know from the repo, what it must ask the user for, and what should be treated as unavailable.

## User/App-Provided Data

These inputs usually do not exist in this repo. Ask for them or mark them missing.

| Data | Needed for |
|------|------------|
| Paywall screenshot, video, or code | Any full audit or visual/layout recommendation |
| App category, purpose, audience, and core value moment | Access model, placement, copy, category benchmark selection |
| Platform and app framework | Implementation guidance, iOS/Android delta, StoreKit/Play Billing advice |
| Subscription provider and config | RevenueCat/Adapty/Apphud/Superwall implementation and remote config checks |
| Product IDs, subscription group, durations, prices, trial/offer setup | Compliance, savings math, plan architecture, entitlement checks |
| Placement IDs, variant IDs, trigger rules, and segments | Audit accuracy, experiment design, lifecycle mapping |
| Funnel metrics and date window | Conversion diagnosis and performance grading |
| Retention, renewal, refund, billing issue, and churn data | LTV, refund diagnosis, lifecycle recommendations |
| Geo, locale, currency, and pricing territory data | Localization and geo-pricing guidance |
| Acquisition mix, CPI/CAC, and campaign source | Unit economics and channel-level recommendations |
| Current experiments, sample sizes, and primary metrics | Test plan and winner/loser interpretation |

## Missing Data Rules

- If a required field is missing, list it in `Missing data` before recommendations.
- If a screenshot is present but context is missing, give screenshot-only findings first and mark missing context separately.
- For paywall design, ask no more than 3 grouped questions before drafting when the missing fields would materially change the spec.
- If the missing field changes the answer materially, do not produce a full recommendation. Give the smallest safe next step.
- Never infer product IDs, prices, trial status, discounts, ratings, testimonials, geo split, provider config, or experiment results.
- Benchmarks are fallback context. User/app data wins when it is real and current.
