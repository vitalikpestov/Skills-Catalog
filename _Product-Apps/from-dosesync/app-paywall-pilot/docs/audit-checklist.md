# Pre-Ship Audit Checklist

Printable / standalone checklist version of the SKILL.md audit. Use when you don't have AI access or want a manual review pass before submitting an App Store update.

50+ items grouped into 8 sections. Each item references the SKILL.md / module section that explains why.

---

## 1. Apple Compliance (rejection-blockers)

These are Apple Rules. Failing any = likely rejection.

- [ ] Clear description of what user gets (Guideline 3.1.2(c))
- [ ] Subscription name and duration visible (3.1.2(c))
- [ ] **Full renewal price is the most prominent pricing element** (3.1.2(c))
- [ ] Trial duration AND post-trial price shown if trial offered (3.1.2(a))
- [ ] Restore Purchases accessible (in-app, not buried)
- [ ] Terms of Use link in-app (clickable, not just text)
- [ ] Privacy Policy link in-app (clickable, not just text)
- [ ] No misleading savings math (every "save X%" verifiable against real reference price)
- [ ] No fake urgency / countdown not tied to real expiry
- [ ] No fake reviews / ratings / user counts
- [ ] Existing paid users keep previously purchased access (no entitlement breakage)
- [ ] **No free-trial toggle paywall on iOS** (Guideline 3.1.2 enforcement; treat as banned)
- [ ] No deceptive plan pre-selection
- [ ] Auto-renewal terms disclosed clearly

## 2. Field Reports (high rejection-correlation, not Apple-published)

Not formal rules, but observed rejection patterns.

- [ ] Pricing font ≥16pt (RevenueFlo field threshold)
- [ ] Close button visible immediately (NOT delayed >5s)
- [ ] No two full paywalls back-to-back (use soft prompt instead — Superwall pattern)
- [ ] Decline copy is neutral ("Maybe later" / "Not now"), not guilt-trip
- [ ] No hidden close button

References: [decision-trees.md](../modules/decision-trees.md) Tree 8.

## 3. Copy Quality

- [ ] Headline is outcome-led, not feature-led ("Sleep better in 7 nights" not "Premium Features")
- [ ] CTA uses action+benefit pattern ("Start my free week", not "Subscribe")
- [ ] 3-5 benefit bullets max
- [ ] Each bullet ≤8 words
- [ ] No weak standalone copy: "Premium", "Subscribe", "Unlock", "Pay" without clear outcome/terms
- [ ] Real social proof above the fold (rating + count, real testimonial, or authority)
- [ ] Trust line includes trial terms + billed amount + restore + terms + privacy
- [ ] Onboarding promise referenced in paywall headline (continuity check)

References: [copy-library.md](../modules/copy-library.md) + [onboarding-paywall-handoff.md](../modules/onboarding-paywall-handoff.md).

---

## 4. Pricing & Plan Architecture

- [ ] 1-3 plans visible (Adapty 2026: 2-plan paywalls 41-60% of apps; 3-plan via Superwall +44%)
- [ ] Selected plan is visually clear (border + badge + background)
- [ ] Annual default if annual LTV > 2x monthly
- [ ] Per-day / per-week breakdown is subordinate to billed amount
- [ ] Trial on annual only (or all plans, with clear reason)
- [ ] Savings math verifiable against reference price
- [ ] Pricing tier appropriate for category (compare to [category-deep-dives.md](../modules/category-deep-dives.md))
- [ ] Apple Small Business Program enrolled if eligible (<$1M annual revenue → +17.6% net ARPU)

## 5. Localization

- [ ] Localized for top 5 revenue markets minimum
- [ ] Manual per-territory pricing for top markets (not just auto-tier)
- [ ] EU pricing 20-30% above NA (capture surplus)
- [ ] Geo-tier consideration for emerging markets >5% of installs (e.g., India, Indonesia)
- [ ] Number formatting localized (€/¥/$/₽ in correct positions)
- [ ] CTA text fits in button at longest locale (DE +30-40% vs EN)
- [ ] Tone matches market expectation (Sie/du in German, vous in French, formality in Japanese)
- [ ] RTL flip tested for Arabic/Hebrew if shipping in MENA

References: [localization.md](../modules/localization.md). Adapty 2026: localization = 62.3% LTV win rate (highest).

---

## 6. Accessibility & Layout

- [ ] Above-fold contains: close X, headline, plan card, CTA
- [ ] Primary CTA in thumb zone (bottom third)
- [ ] WCAG AA contrast on CTA (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] Tap targets ≥44pt (Apple HIG)
- [ ] Dynamic Type tested up to AX5
- [ ] VoiceOver labels on all interactive elements
- [ ] Reduce Motion respected
- [ ] Dark mode tested
- [ ] Safe areas respected (status bar, dynamic island, home indicator)
- [ ] No information conveyed by color alone (colorblind users)

References: [screen-anatomy.md](../modules/screen-anatomy.md).

## 7. Implementation & Lifecycle

- [ ] Restore Purchase implemented and tested
- [ ] Already-entitled user handled (don't show paywall to active subscriber)
- [ ] Network failure UX (specific copy: "Couldn't connect. Try again.")
- [ ] Purchase cancellation UX (silent return, no friction)
- [ ] Analytics events fired: paywall_impression, dismissed, plan_selected, purchase_started/completed/failed
- [ ] Server Notifications V2 wired (App Store) / RTDN (Play)
- [ ] Trial reminder push at Day -3 / Day -1 (Blinkist pattern)
- [ ] Renewal-risk push at Day -25 if auto-renew turned off
- [ ] Win-back offer configured (Apple Win-Back iOS 18+)
- [ ] Refund consumption API implemented for refund decline
- [ ] MMP integrated (AppsFlyer / Adjust / Singular) for channel-level CAC
- [ ] Cohort dashboards set up (RC / Adapty / Apphud)

## 8. 2026 Store Policy Watch

- [ ] If using Apple monthly subscriptions with a 12-month commitment, gate by supported storefront/OS and explain completed/remaining payments clearly
- [ ] If Health & Fitness / Medical or medical-treatment references, provide regulated medical device status in App Store Connect where required
- [ ] If raising Apple subscription prices in Austria, Germany, or Poland, account for customer consent requirements
- [ ] If marketing offers on Apple, use offer codes for IAP; don't plan new IAP promo codes after March 26, 2026
- [ ] If shipping Android in applicable US states, check Play Age Signals / in-app product age rating requirements
- [ ] If monetizing China mainland on iOS, use the 2026 commission rates in unit economics
- [ ] If using external purchase flows, gate them by storefront/OS (US, EU, Japan rules differ)
