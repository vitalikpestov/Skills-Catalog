# Migration: From Toggle Paywall to Compliant Pattern

Apple started rejecting free-trial toggle paywalls under Guideline 3.1.2 in mid-January 2026. Treat this as a hard iOS ban for runtime guidance. If your app was caught in this wave, this is the migration playbook.

For taxonomy of paywall types, see SKILL.md PRESENTATION PATTERN. For specific rejection triage, see [decision-trees.md](../../modules/decision-trees.md) Tree 8.

## What Apple Said

**Guideline cited:** 3.1.2 (Business — Payments — Subscriptions)

**Apple's exact reason:**
> "The purchase screen includes a toggle to add or remove a free trial from the subscription purchase. This design is confusing and may prevent users from understanding that they are committing to an auto-renewing subscription."

**Sources:**
- RevenueCat: https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/r-i-p-toggle-paywall-we-hardly-knew-ye/
- Adapty: https://adapty.io/blog/your-toggle-paywall-is-about-to-get-rejected/
- Multiple developer reports starting mid-January 2026

**Scope:** iOS. Android Play Store and web checkouts have not shown the same rejection wave, but cross-platform consistency usually argues for replacing the pattern everywhere.

## What Got Rejected

The classic toggle paywall pattern:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Premium Annual                          │
│  $59.99/year                             │
│                                          │
│  Free trial:  [ON  /  OFF ]   ← Toggle  │
│                                          │
│  [Continue]                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The toggle defaulted to **off**, meaning the user paid upfront without knowing they could have had a trial. Many users skipped the toggle interaction → revenue went up → Apple eventually flagged.

---

## Replacement Patterns

You have 4 compliant alternatives. Pick based on your existing data + product fit.

### Option 1: Separate Plan Cards (Most Common)

Two distinct plan cards — trial as one option, no-trial as another.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓  Annual + 7-day free trial            │
│     $59.99/year after trial              │
│     Cancel anytime during trial          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Annual                                │
│     $59.99/year                           │
│     Pay now, no trial                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Continue]
```

**Pros:** Clearest user understanding. Apple-friendly.
**Cons:** Requires two SKUs configured in App Store Connect.

### Option 2: Trial-on-Annual-Only

Single plan card, trial bundled with annual. No choice = no confusion.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓  Premium Annual                       │
│     7-day free trial                     │
│     then $59.99/year                     │
│     Cancel anytime                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Start Free Trial]
```

**Pros:** Simplest implementation. Adapty Operator Insight: "one of the most consistent patterns."
**Cons:** Less optionality for users; some research suggests subset of users prefer no-trial direct purchase.

### Option 3: Multi-Plan Comparison

3-plan card layout with trial on one selected plan, no toggle.

```
┌─────────┐ ┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────┐
│ Weekly  │ │ ✓  Annual   │ │ Monthly │
│ $4.99   │ │   7-day FREE │ │ $9.99   │
│         │ │   then $59   │ │         │
└─────────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────┘

[Start Free Trial]
```

**Pros:** Standard pattern, supports decoy effect (Ariely), works with Superwall product-count data (+44% from 3-plan layout).
**Cons:** More design work; needs equal-LTV math across plans.

### Option 4: Personalized / Conditional

Different default plan shown based on user segment. No toggle, but the "right" plan surfaces per user.

```
For low-intent user → Weekly plan default + trial
For high-intent user → Annual plan default + trial
```

**Pros:** Tinder-style ML-driven approach; highest LTV potential.
**Cons:** Engineering complexity; requires user segmentation infrastructure.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Configure App Store Connect

If switching to **separate plan cards**:
1. Create 2 subscription products in same Subscription Group:
   - `your_app_annual_trial` with 7-day free trial intro offer
   - `your_app_annual_direct` (no intro offer)
2. Both at same price ($59.99/year)
3. Mark both as "ready for sale"

If switching to **trial-on-annual-only**:
1. Keep your existing annual product with intro offer
2. Remove the no-trial variant from the paywall (you can leave it active for legacy users)

### Step 2: Update Paywall UI

- Remove toggle component
- Add plan card layout (see options 1-4 above)
- Verify selected state is visually clear
- Verify trial terms appear next to the trial card

### Step 3: Update Analytics

- Add new event: `plan_card_selected` with plan_id
- Keep old `paywall_impression` events
- Track trial-on vs direct: are users splitting like you expect?

### Step 4: Test

- VoiceOver accessibility on all plan cards
- Dark mode rendering
- Localization (CTA might need to change: "Start Free Trial" vs "Subscribe")
- Restore Purchase still works for old toggle-paywall purchases

### Step 5: Submit Update

- Reference the rejection in your update notes if applicable
- Don't try to "sneak through" — Apple reviewers know this pattern

### Step 6: Monitor

For first 30 days post-launch, watch:
- Trial start rate
- Trial-to-paid rate
- Direct purchase rate
- Refund rate and support complaints
- Renewal quality by plan

## Expected Impact

Directional expectation from Adapty / RevenueCat / RevenueFlo reports:

| Metric | Pre-toggle-removal | Post-toggle-removal | Why |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|-----|
| Trial start rate | often inflated or unclear | may normalize | Users see trial terms directly instead of toggling |
| Trial-to-paid rate | mixed | may improve | Trial users are less accidental |
| Direct purchase | can be artificially high | may drop | Some direct buyers likely missed trial availability |
| Refund/support complaints | can be elevated | should improve if surprise billing falls | Terms are clearer |
| **Net LTV** | app-specific | unknown until cohort read | Lower surprise revenue can be offset by quality and fewer refunds |

**Caveat:** Do not model this as a guaranteed lift. Run a cohort comparison post-launch (see [cohort-analysis.md](../../modules/cohort-analysis.md)).

---

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ **Don't ship a "subtle" trial toggle hoping Apple won't notice.** Treat it as banned on iOS.
- ❌ **Don't bury the trial in a "Plans" submenu.** Apple wants trial visible at the same level as the plan.
- ❌ **Don't replace toggle with a popup that asks "do you want a trial?"** Same UX problem rebranded.
- ❌ **Don't remove the trial entirely as a "fix."** Trial-acquired subscribers retain 1.4-1.7x better.

---

## When You Get Re-Rejected

If you replace the toggle but still get rejected:

1. Check that the trial price is **clearly visible next to the trial plan** (Apple Rule)
2. Check that "Free trial then $X/year" reads clearly without scroll
3. Check that the close button isn't delayed >5s (Field Report risk)
4. Check that you don't have two full paywalls back-to-back (Field Report risk)
5. Use [decision-trees.md](../../modules/decision-trees.md) Tree 8 for full triage

---

## Migrations for Other Bans (Likely Future Patterns)

Apple's enforcement style suggests these patterns may face similar bans:

| Pattern | Risk |
|---------|------|
| "Hidden close" buttons (delayed >5s) | High — Field Report 2026 |
| Pricing fonts <16pt | Moderate — RevenueFlo field threshold |
| Two paywalls back-to-back | High — already cited as "aggressive monetization" |
| Fake countdown timers | Already explicit Apple Rule violation |

When in doubt, transparency is the safest design philosophy.
