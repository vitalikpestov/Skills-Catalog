# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `framework-meta.json` as single source of truth for version, counts, canonical research brief, and calculator paths
- `tools/sync_repo_meta.py` + `.github/scripts/validate_repo_meta.py` to keep top-level docs aligned with repo facts
- `tools/ltv_calculator.py` as importable calculator module with strict validation
- `tests/test_ltv_calculator.py` for calculator regression coverage

### Changed
- README / SKILL / ROADMAP now point to `outputs/2026-paywall-research-v2.md` as canonical brief; legacy brief kept for history
- SKILL taxonomy corrected from "three axes" to four axes
- SKILL data-source section slimmed down to routing guidance instead of duplicating source database
- ROADMAP migration strategy simplified: no planned symlink / re-export layer

## [4.0.0] -- 2026-04-17

**Reframed from "Claude Code skill" to "Framework".** No breaking changes — all v3.x installations continue to work at the same paths. This is a positioning / documentation upgrade to reflect what the project actually is.

### Why this version

Honest assessment: the repo grew from a single SKILL.md file (v1.0) through 16 modules, a Python calculator, 2 research briefs, 3 worked examples, audit checklist, migration playbook, and CI validation. Calling it "just a skill" stopped matching what users encounter when they clone the repo.

### Added
- **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** -- documents framework architecture and planned expansion to 5 adjacent domains (Onboarding v5, Retention v6, Growth v7, Pricing v8, Reviews v9). Also lists explicit non-goals.
- **README Architecture section** -- 4-layer diagram (Skill / Knowledge / Tool / Reference) with "which layer do you need" use-case mapping.
- **README Roadmap section** -- summary table of planned domains with priority and release targets.
- **Framework positioning** throughout README -- replacing "skill"-only framing where it was misleading.

### Changed
- Hero title: "App Paywall Pilot" -> "Paywall Pilot Framework"
- Hero subtitle: "AI copilot... for paywalls" -> "A framework for designing paywalls. AI skill + knowledge base + executable tool."
- Badges: added "Framework: Paywall" badge signaling flagship domain + future expansion
- "Use this when..." section: "the skill activates" -> "the framework activates"
- "Modules" section header: "The skill is split" -> "The Skill layer is split"

### Unchanged (intentionally)
- File structure stays flat; domain folders arrive in v5.0 with backward-compat symlinks
- All module paths remain stable
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter and behavior unchanged -- Claude Code / other AI tools read it identically
- `sources.json` structure unchanged
- Python calculator unchanged
- Repo name stays `app-paywall-pilot` (SEO / link stability)

### Migration
No action required. Existing `git clone ~/.claude/skills/app-paywall-pilot/` installations continue to function. New users get the framework positioning; existing users get unchanged functionality.

## [3.8.0] -- 2026-04-16

Layer 2 of academic foundations beyond v3.7.0 Kahneman base. Adds 9 rigorous behavioral-science concepts plus explicit replication-failure warning for ego depletion.

### Added
- **`outputs/2026-paywall-research-v2.md`** -- Layer 2 research brief with 12 concepts verified for primary citation, replication evidence, and paywall design rule. Includes provenance sidecar.
- **`pricing-psychology.md`** -- new Layer 2 section with 9 academic-strong concepts:
  12. **Fogg Behavior Model B = M × A × T** (Fogg 2009, Persuasive Tech proceedings, 1,900+ pubs ref) -- when motivation is borderline, reduce ability friction
  13. **Choice Overload** (Iyengar & Lepper 2000, JPSP) -- 6-jam vs 24-jam study (10x conv difference); 2-3 plans is the sweet spot. Includes Scheibehenne 2010 meta-analysis caveat.
  14. **IKEA Effect** (Norton, Mochon, Ariely 2012, JCP) -- self-made products valued as much as expert-made; explains long-onboarding paywalls (Noom, Flo, Cal AI). Completion required.
  15. **Hyperbolic Discounting** (Laibson 1997, QJE) -- present bias; explains weekly-plan dominance and per-day framing
  16. **Goal-Gradient Effect** (Kivetz, Urminsky, Zheng 2006, JMR) -- effort accelerates near reward; bonus head-start works (12-stamp card with 2 free completes faster than regular 10-stamp)
  17. **Negativity Bias** (Baumeister et al 2001, RGP, 10K+ citations) -- bad outweighs good across all domains; refund rate matters more than conversion rate
  18. **Costly Signaling** (Spence 1973, QJE, Nobel 2001) -- premium pricing signals quality; explains 3x LTV uplift of high-priced apps
  19. **Reactance Theory** (Brehm 1966) -- threatened freedom triggers opposite behavior; fake urgency backfires
  20. **Sunk Cost Fallacy** (Arkes & Blumer 1985, OBHDP) -- past investment commits future behavior; combines with IKEA Effect + Goal-Gradient in long onboarding
- **Explicit ego-depletion replication-failure warning** in pricing-psychology.md: Hagger 2016 (24 labs, 2,141 participants) + Vohs 2016 (36 labs, 3,531 participants) both found no effect. Do NOT cite as mechanism.
- **Practitioner frameworks section** clearly labeled as Operator Insight (not academic): Hooked Model (Eyal 2014) and Atomic Habits identity (Clear 2018), with underlying academic basis cited (Skinner / IKEA / Sunk Cost for Hooked; Bem 1972 + Cialdini for identity habits).
- **`glossary.md`** -- 12 new behavioral concept definitions (9 Layer 2 + ego depletion warning + 2 practitioner frameworks).
- **`sources.json`** -- 11 new academic entries with full citations, journals, sample sizes where applicable.

### Changed
- **SKILL.md MODULES table** -- pricing-psychology description updated to "20-concept academic foundation" with full breakdown.
- **SKILL.md DATA SOURCES table** -- 9 new bold rows for Layer 2 academic foundations + ⚠️ ego depletion entry.
- **README.md** -- badge "Kahneman 11 concepts" -> "Academic 20 concepts"; sources count 69 -> 80.

### Critical correction
The skill no longer attributes "keep paywalls simple" to ego depletion / decision fatigue. The mechanism is now correctly cited as **Choice Overload (Iyengar & Lepper 2000) + System 1 (Kahneman 2011) + WYSIATI (Kahneman 2011)**. The practical UX rule is unchanged; the underlying science is upgraded.

## [3.7.0] -- 2026-04-16

Major expansion of Kahneman behavioral foundations. Now functions as the trusted base of all paywall design recommendations.

### Added
- **`pricing-psychology.md` — 11-concept Kahneman foundation section.** Each concept gets: full citation (paper, journal, year), the empirical finding, mobile paywall application with concrete examples, and a design rule. Concepts:
  1. **Prospect Theory & Loss Aversion** (Kahneman & Tversky 1979, Econometrica, 65K+ citations, 2002 Nobel)
  2. **Anchoring** (Tversky & Kahneman 1974, Science)
  3. **System 1 / System 2** (Kahneman 2011, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*)
  4. **Endowment Effect** (Kahneman, Knetsch & Thaler 1990, Journal of Political Economy)
  5. **Peak-End Rule** (Kahneman et al 1993, Psychological Science)
  6. **Default Effect / Status Quo Bias** (Kahneman, Knetsch, Thaler 1991, Journal of Economic Perspectives)
  7. **Mental Accounting** (Thaler 1980-1999, built on Kahneman)
  8. **WYSIATI** (Kahneman 2011, *Thinking, Fast and Slow* Ch. 7)
  9. **Substitution Heuristic** (Kahneman 2011, Ch. 9)
  10. **Planning Fallacy** (Kahneman & Tversky 1979)
  11. **Hedonic Adaptation** (Kahneman, Diener, Schwarz 1999)
- Summary table: Kahneman concept → direct paywall design lever.
- **`sources.json` — 11 new academic entries** with full citations, journal, sample size where applicable.
- **`glossary.md` — new "Behavioral / Cognitive Concepts" section** with quick definitions for all 11 Kahneman concepts plus Decoy Effect and Cialdini, each linking source and paywall use.

### Changed
- **`copy-library.md`** — headline formulas behavioral lens upgraded:
  - Loss-frame headline (#7) now cites Kahneman & Tversky 1979 Prospect Theory directly with "recommended default for trial expiry" guidance
  - All headlines linked to System 1 requirement (3-second comprehension)
  - Social Proof Templates section now opens with Substitution Heuristic explanation: why social proof beats feature lists scientifically (brain swaps "is this worth $X?" for "do I trust this?")
- **`decision-trees.md` Tree 4 (plan architecture)** — added Default Effect citation as the scientific backing for "always pre-select a plan." Added WYSIATI rule: "anything below scroll fold doesn't exist for the decision."
- **`screen-anatomy.md`** — 3-second rule now scientifically grounded as System 1 decision window. Above-fold rules now grounded in WYSIATI as the strongest argument for Apple "billed amount most prominent" rule.
- **SKILL.md DATA SOURCES table** — added 7 Kahneman papers explicitly (Prospect Theory promoted to bold), Mental Accounting (Thaler), and the consolidated Kahneman 2011 reference covering System 1/2 + WYSIATI + Substitution.
- **SKILL.md MODULES table** — pricing-psychology description updated to reflect 11-concept Kahneman foundation.

### Note on attribution
This is a **trusted base** layer. Where Adapty/RC/Superwall vendor data exists, it's directional. Where Kahneman is cited, it's foundational behavioral science. Design choices grounded in Kahneman should be considered durable; vendor-data-only choices should be treated as Operator Insight or Hypothesis until the underlying mechanism is also explained.

## [3.6.0] -- 2026-04-16

Data refresh + README redesign.

### Changed
- **README header redesigned** with jobs-to-be-done framing. New "Use this when…" table maps 10 concrete user situations to "what to ask your AI" + "which modules activate". New "What you get" table maps 6 outputs to deliverables + powered-by modules. Hero badges upgraded to for-the-badge style. Anchor links + table-of-contents added.
- **ChatGPT teardown trimmed** to remove model-version trivia (GPT-5.x specifics change every quarter and are not paywall-design relevant). Now focuses on the durable lessons: $20/mo consumer baseline, $200/mo premium ceiling (10x Plus), $8/mo geo-tier for emerging markets. Added explicit note: "don't put model version names in your paywall copy unless you commit to updating it every quarter."
- ChatGPT pricing-tier source updated: was "Free/Go/Plus/Business/Enterprise/Edu" (outdated), now "Free/Go/Plus/Pro/Business/Enterprise" (April 2026 verified via OpenAI public pricing page).
- ChatGPT pricing source URL updated to https://chatgpt.com/pricing/

### Note
The skill is for **all subscription apps**, not just AI. ChatGPT is one of 11 teardowns and AI is one of 10 categories. Treat AI examples as comparable references, not as the focus.

## [3.5.0] -- 2026-04-16

Phase 3 of follow-up improvements. Adds polish modules (refund management, cohort analysis), worked-audit examples, audit checklist, migration playbook, and CI validation.

### Added

- **`examples/audit-h-and-f-app.md`** -- worked audit for fictional H&F app showing full 12-section DEFAULT OUTPUT FORMAT with calculator-predicted LTV impact.
- **`examples/audit-ai-app.md`** -- worked audit for AI app emphasizing post-aha placement, ChatGPT $20 baseline, geo-tier pricing for emerging markets.
- **`examples/audit-productivity-app.md`** -- worked audit for Productivity app showing the counter-intuitive trial economics (direct buyers > trial buyers per RC 2026), comparison-table presentation pattern, sophisticated audience pricing.
- **`.github/workflows/validate.yml`** -- CI pipeline that runs on push and PR: validates sources.json structure (required fields, allowed evidence classes), checks all internal markdown links resolve, smoke-tests LTV calculator with both direct-CR and trial-funnel inputs, enforces SKILL.md size guard (1500 lines max).
- **`.github/scripts/validate_sources.py`** -- standalone sources.json validator.
- **`.github/scripts/validate_links.py`** -- standalone link validator (caught 3 broken links during initial run).

### Changed
- Module count: 14 -> 16
- Added docs/ tree with audit-checklist + migrations/
- Added examples/ tree with 3 worked audits
- SKILL.md MODULES table updated with all Phase 3 entries

### Fixed
- 3 broken internal links in docs/migrations/from-toggle-paywall.md (off-by-one path depth)

## [3.4.0] -- 2026-04-16

Phase 2 of follow-up improvements. Adds foundational modules that fill gaps identified after Phase 1: continuity onboarding-paywall, lifecycle messaging, canonical metric definitions, executable Python calculator.

### Added
- **`modules/onboarding-paywall-handoff.md`** -- continuity principle (core principle 10) made concrete. 7 onboarding patterns linked to paywall: Noom quiz (77 screens), Cal AI demo-first, Headspace segmented + day/night, Duolingo goal-first, Strava aha-moment, Flo empathy, reverse trial. Loading-screen bridge templates with timing rules. Decision rule for short vs medium vs long onboarding by LTV.
- **`modules/notifications-lifecycle.md`** -- previously missing area. Push + email sequences for trial (Blinkist Day-5 +1,200% opt-in), transaction abandon (Superwall 17% revenue), renewal-risk (Server Notifications V2), billing-issue (system sheet), win-back (iOS 18+ Apple Win-Back). Permission strategy with timing benchmarks. Copy templates per scenario. Tooling comparison (OneSignal / FCM / Customer.io / Iterable / Klaviyo).
- **`modules/glossary.md`** -- canonical definitions for ARPU vs ARPPU, gross LTV vs RLTV, CR variants (effective CR breakdown), MRR/ARR, CAC variants (CPI/CPR/CAC/eCAC), ROAS, retention vs renewal vs churn, plan architecture terms (Subscription Group vs Base Plan + Offer), data-source class definitions. Plus 24-acronym quick reference.
- **`tools/ltv-calculator.py`** -- executable Python implementation of unit-economics-calculator.md. CLI + JSON I/O modes. Implements all default retention multipliers, performance grading, expert advice engine. Verified output matches the worked example in the module ($48.44 ARPPU 7d, 1.26:1 LTV:CAC at 4yr). Runs in any environment with Python 3.

### Changed
- Module count: 11 -> 14
- SKILL.md MODULES table updated with all Phase 2 entries

## [3.3.0] -- 2026-04-16

Phase 1 of follow-up improvements after analyzing adaptyteam/growth-expert-skill. Closes the operational/numerical gap (we were strong on strategy, weak on calculator-style guidance and CAC).

### Added
- **`modules/unit-economics-calculator.md`** -- conversational LTV / ARPU / ROAS / breakeven calculator. Step-by-step input collection, default retention multipliers per plan type, performance grading thresholds (Excellent / Good / Average / Below / Critical), expert advice engine with 11 conditional recommendations, scenario modeling, full worked example. Inspired by adaptyteam/growth-expert-skill calculator pattern, extended with cross-vendor (RC + Superwall + AppsFlyer) thresholds.
- **`modules/indie-dev-faq.md`** -- 35+ direct-answer Q&A grouped into Pricing & Plans, Trials, Conversion & Funnel, Retention & Churn, Markets & Geography, Acquisition & UA, Compliance & Apple, Strategy & Growth. Each answer = threshold + verdict + one action with cited source.
- **`modules/cac-acquisition.md`** -- previously missing area. CAC formula + variants (CPI / CPR / CAC / eCAC), 2026 mobile CAC benchmarks for iOS / Android premium and emerging markets, channel CPI table (ASA / Meta / TikTok / Google / Snap / Reddit / Twitter / Influencer), LTV:CAC thresholds with verdicts, channel mix strategy by stage, MMP comparison (AppsFlyer / Adjust / Singular / RevenueCat), ASA campaign-type breakdown, Web2App economics, common CAC mistakes, when CAC doesn't apply.
- **RESPONSE MODE: PICK ONE** section in SKILL.md -- explicit guidance to match response depth to question. Quick mode (single tactical Q) vs Calculator mode vs Pattern mode vs Full audit vs Compliance triage. Stops the skill from running 12-section audit when user asked one question.
- **QUICK MODE FORMAT** in SKILL.md -- Verdict / Reason / Action template for single-question responses.
- **The Hollow Middle** subsection in pricing-psychology.md -- 41% subscription fatigue, $5-10/mo dead zone, 2026 trend toward either $30+/mo measurable outcomes OR $5/wk + free tier.
- **Apple Small Business Program** subsection in pricing-psychology.md -- 15% vs 30% commission at <$1M revenue, +17.6% net ARPU instantly. Highest-leverage zero-effort change for indie devs.

### Changed
