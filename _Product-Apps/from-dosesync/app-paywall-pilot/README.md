## 🏗️ Architecture

Paywall Pilot is **not just a Claude Code skill** (though it works as one). It's a 4-layer framework, designed to be used whole or per-layer.

Runtime behavior is intentionally smaller than this README: agents should start from [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md), then use [`runtime/`](runtime/) for input contracts, routing, and source lookup rules.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## ⚡ Use this when…

Concrete jobs-to-be-done. Match your situation; the framework activates the relevant modules automatically.

| 👤 Your situation | 💬 Ask your AI… | 🧩 What activates |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **You're designing your first paywall.** | "Help me design the paywall for my new fitness app." | Full audit · taxonomy · screen anatomy · copy library · category benchmarks |
| **Apple just rejected you.** | "I got rejected for Guideline 3.1.2. Help me fix it." | Compliance triage · toggle-paywall migration playbook · field-report decision tree |
| **You don't know if your numbers are good.** | "Install→trial 9%, trial→paid 22%, refund 6%. Are these OK?" | Indie Dev FAQ · category benchmarks · performance grading |
| **You need to know if you'll be profitable.** | "I have 40k installs, $3 CPI, annual $79.99 / monthly $9.99 (50/50). Will I break even?" | Unit Economics Calculator (Python + module) · ROAS projection · what-if scenarios |
| **You don't know what to test next.** | "I have 2 weeks before launch. What's the highest-leverage test?" | Decision-tree #7 (test priority) · Adapty 2026 win rates · sample-size minimums |
| **You want to copy what big apps do.** | "How does Calm/Noom/Cal AI/Tinder structure their paywall?" | Annotated big-app teardowns with sources |
| **Your trial-to-paid is low.** | "Trial-to-paid is 18% — why?" | Decision-tree #3 · Blinkist Trial Timeline pattern · notifications-lifecycle |
| **You're expanding to new markets.** | "I'm US-only at $79.99/yr. Where should I expand and at what price?" | Localization · pricing index US=1.0 · AppsFlyer 2026 emerging-markets data |
| **You need better paywall copy.** | "Write 3 headline variants for my running app paywall." | Copy library: 12 headline formulas · Copy Ladder · weak/risky words · locale notes |
| **Your refund rate is high.** | "Annual refund rate is 7% — what's wrong?" | Refund management · Apple Consumption API · channel-level diagnostic |

If your situation isn't on this list, just send a screenshot and say *"Audit my paywall"*. You get a concise screenshot-first audit by default; ask for a deep audit when you want the full breakdown.

## 🚫 The problem this solves

Most paywall advice is one of three things, all of them broken in 2026:

1. **Generic web CRO** — ignores App Store rules and gets your app rejected.
2. **Hype-driven single-app case studies** — no methodology, no sample size, may not transfer.
3. **Outdated tactics** — toggle paywalls were the 2024 gold standard; Apple started rejecting trial-toggle purchase screens under Guideline 3.1.2 in January 2026. Treat them as banned on iOS.

And most AI assistants compound the problem: they recommend whatever pattern they saw most often in 2023 training data, with no source, no compliance check, and no awareness of category economics.

## ✅ The fix

Paywall Pilot Framework grounds every recommendation in **published evidence with confidence labels**, **never** invents data, and **explicitly states when to ignore benchmarks** (e.g., when N<1,000 subs/variant or when your category is niche).

| Principle | How |
|-----------|-----|
| **🛡️ Compliance first** | Every recommendation checked against Apple App Store Review Guidelines. Apple Rule > vendor data, always. |
| **📊 7-level evidence ladder** | Every claim labeled from Apple Rule down to Hypothesis — no unmarked assertions. |
| **🔗 Sourced data** | Every benchmark carries source + date + sample size. Canonical manifest lives in [`sources.json`](sources.json) and is validated locally. |
| **🏛️ Big-app teardowns** | 11 annotated paywall analyses (Calm, Duolingo, Noom, Cal AI, Tinder, Strava, Headspace, Blinkist, Flo, ChatGPT, AI companions). |
| **🎓 Academic foundations** | Pricing psychology grounded in Tversky-Kahneman 1981 (*Science*), Anderson-Simester 2003, Thomas-Morwitz 2005, Ariely 2008, Cialdini — not just blog posts. |
| **♻️ Full lifecycle** | 10 stages from first purchase through win-back. Notifications, refunds, cohorts. |
| **🧩 Modular** | Core SKILL.md plus deep-dive modules loaded on demand by topic. |
| **🧠 Common-sense overrides** | Explicit "WHEN TO IGNORE BENCHMARKS" guidance for small N, niche category, recent launch. |
| **🤖 LLM-agnostic** | Works with Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini — any AI tool with custom instructions. |

## What's Inside

<details>
<summary><strong>7-Level Evidence Ladder</strong></summary>

Every recommendation carries a confidence label. Higher = more reliable.

| Level | Label | Meaning |

<summary><strong>10-Category Matrix</strong></summary>

Different categories have different economics. Do not apply one playbook to all apps. Full per-category deep-dives in [modules/category-deep-dives.md](modules/category-deep-dives.md).

| Category | Dominant Plan | Trial Impact | Notable 2026 stat |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Health & Fitness | 60.6% annual | Trial helps (35-42% trial-to-paid) | Install LTV $1.21 (highest of any category) |
| Gaming | 82% weekly | Short trial works | 73% use ≤4-day trials |
| Productivity | 77% monthly | Trial **hurts** LTV ($56.95 direct vs $49.13 trial) | Direct buyers preferred |
| Lifestyle | Mixed | Direct buyers ~21% more valuable at 12mo | Similar to Productivity |
| Education | Annual / mixed | Trial users +50.4% 12-mo LTV | Highest discount usage (14.3%) |
| AI Apps | 59.8% monthly | Higher pricing tolerated, churn 30% faster | $20/mo (ChatGPT) is the baseline |
| Photo & Video | Mixed | Trial-to-paid 22.2% (lowest) | APAC refund rate 14.1% |
| Travel | 3+ plans | Trial-to-paid 43.5% (highest) | Annual median $20 (lowest) |
| Shopping | 1-plan dominant | Mixed monetization | 40% use single-plan paywalls |
| Business / B2B | Annual | Trial filters intent | $35.48 12-mo RLTV per payer |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Geography Cuts</strong> -- where to focus in 2026</summary>

Per AppsFlyer 2026 (1.7B installs, 2,900 apps): subscription UA spend grew 24% YoY but the growth is **not where you might think**.

| Region | D30 Trial | D35 Paid | D14 RPI | 12-mo RLTV per payer |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|----------------------|
| North America | 7.1% | 2.8% | $0.38 | $32 |
| Western Europe | mid | mid | mid | $25 |
| IN/SEA | 3.0-3.7% | 0.7% | $0.08 | $14 |

- **Android growing 4x faster than iOS** in subscription UA
- **Indian Subcontinent: 49% of net Android paid install growth**; LATAM: 18%
- **North America: essentially flat**
- **Top 5 apps per category control >90% of UA spend** (high concentration risk)
- **Western Europe charges 29-39% more than North America** -- huge under-priced opportunity

Strategic implication: NA-only apps face flat user pool; emerging markets are where Android growth happens. Geo-tier pricing (ChatGPT Go @ $8 for India) is increasingly important.

</details>

### 6-Phase Process

```
Discovery & Audit --> Paywall Strategy --> Screen Design
        |                                        |
        v                                        v
iOS Compliance  <-- Implementation  <-- Testing Plan
```

1. **Discovery & Audit** -- understand the app, audit existing paywall, Apple Analytics benchmarks
2. **Paywall Strategy** -- access model, trigger points, plan architecture
3. **Screen Design** -- value block, pricing, CTA, trust/legal
4. **Testing Plan** -- what to test first (structure > polish)
5. **Implementation** -- Adapty, RevenueCat, StoreKit 2, Google Billing
6. **iOS Compliance** -- pre-ship checklist with Apple Rule vs Apple Guidance distinction

### 10-Stage Lifecycle Monetization

| Stage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| First purchase | Main paywall |
| Post-close recovery | Discounted offer (banner) |
| Transaction abandon | Soft prompt with alternative |
| Trial-to-paid | Reminder / value reinforcement |
| Renewal risk | Promotional offer to retain |
| Billing issue | Grace period UX + retry |
| Price increase | Consent flow |
| Win-back | Win-back offer (iOS 18+) |
| Plan upgrade | Upsell to higher tier |
| Refund / support | Support surface, consumption data |

### 6 Screen Templates + 5 New Paywall Types

| Template | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Post-Onboarding** | Hard paywall after onboarding quiz |
| **Feature Gate** | User taps a locked premium feature |
| **Usage Limit** | Free tier cap reached |
| **Transaction Abandon** | User cancelled payment sheet |
| **Post-Close Offer** | Dismissed main paywall -- show banner |
| **Win-Back** | Lapsed subscriber returns |

Plus: Metered Paywall, Reverse Trial, One-Time Unlock, Renewal-Risk / Churn-Save, Intent-Tiered Paywall.

### Big-App Teardowns

Annotated breakdowns of 11 high-revenue subscription apps in [modules/teardowns.md](modules/teardowns.md). One-line summary:

| App | Single biggest pattern |
|-----|------------------------|
| **Calm** | Single plan (no tier choice) -- universal value = no choice paralysis |
| **Duolingo** | Brand-consistent paywall + "Start my free week" CTA pattern |
| **Noom** | 77-step onboarding -> "your reserved plan" -> paywall |
| **Cal AI** | Hard paywall + obsessive personalization + single core action ($1.4M/mo profit) |
| **Tinder** | Blur-to-reveal Zeigarnik tension + ML-driven dynamic paywall |
| **Strava** | 30-day trial without credit card (ultimate trust signal) |
| **Headspace** | Equal-prominence monthly + annual (NOT annual-default) + day/night theming |
| **Blinkist** | Trial Timeline visual: +23% trial signups, -55% complaints, +1,200% notif opt-in |

### Apple Compliance (2026)

- **Toggle paywall ban** (killed Jan 2026, Guideline 3.1.2): Apple-cited reason: *"This design is confusing and may prevent users from understanding that they are committing to an auto-renewing subscription."*
- Billed amount must be most prominent pricing element
- Trial duration + post-trial price required if trial offered
- Restore Purchases, Terms, Privacy links required
- Apple Rule vs Apple Guidance distinction for subscription groups, freemium, metered models
- Family Sharing as trust lever
- Field reports (RevenueFlo): pricing fonts <16pt, delayed close >5s, two paywalls back-to-back, guilt decline copy = high rejection risk
- Full "Must Have" + "Must NOT Have" checklists inside

### Pricing Psychology -- Academic Foundations

Mobile paywall pricing isn't invented in vendor blogs. The foundational research:

- **Tversky & Kahneman 1981** -- Framing effects (gain vs loss). *Science*, 17,000+ citations.
- **Anderson & Simester 2003** -- $9 endings outsell $4 endings in field experiments. *Quantitative Marketing and Economics*.
- **Thomas & Morwitz 2005** -- Left-digit effect: $9.99 anchors on "9". *Journal of Consumer Research*.
- **Ariely 2008** -- Decoy effect (Economist subscription experiment). *Predictably Irrational*.
- **Cialdini 1984 + Pre-Suasion 2016** -- 7 principles of influence. Springer 2024 mobile-app study: Social Proof + Authority test as most influential.

## How to Use

### Claude Code

Quickest start (clone the whole skill including modules):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikolai-Iakubovskii/app-paywall-pilot \
  ~/.claude/skills/app-paywall-pilot
```

Then run `/app-paywall-pilot` in your project. The core SKILL.md loads first; modules load on demand when relevant.

Single-file install (core only):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/app-paywall-pilot
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/app-paywall-pilot/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolai-Iakubovskii/app-paywall-pilot/main/SKILL.md
```

### Codex CLI
Add `SKILL.md` content to your project's `AGENTS.md` or custom instructions. Reference modules via raw GitHub URLs.

### ChatGPT / GPT-5 / GPT-5.3
Paste `SKILL.md` as a system prompt, then ask: *"Audit my paywall"* with a screenshot. For deeper analysis, also paste the relevant module (e.g. `teardowns.md` when comparing to Calm).

### Cursor / Windsurf / AI IDEs
Add `SKILL.md` to your project root or AI rules config. Modules in `modules/` will be findable in workspace.

### Standalone (no AI tool)
Read `SKILL.md` and the modules directly -- they're a structured knowledge base that works without any AI tool. Designed to be human-readable.

---

## Example Output

Ask your AI: *"Audit my paywall"* with a screenshot. The default output is **12 sections**:

```
1. Current state           -- app context, placement, plan config
2. Main problem            -- plain language
3. Recommended access model -- from taxonomy
4. Recommended placements   -- from taxonomy
5. Recommended presentation -- from taxonomy
6. Screen content           -- headline, benefits, pricing, CTA, trust
7. Copy variants            -- 2-3 short and long versions, Copy Ladder rung
8. Layout sketch            -- ASCII or block diagram, thumb-zone confirmed
9. Localization notes       -- pricing per market, CTA length budget per locale
10. Tests to run            -- ranked by Adapty 2026 win rate (localization first)
11. iOS review risks        -- Apple Rules + Field Reports
12. Android delta           -- Play Billing differences if cross-platform
```

Each finding labeled with its evidence level.

## What This Is NOT

- **Not a web pricing page optimizer** -- in-app subscription flows only
- **Not a guarantee** -- benchmarks are directional; SKILL.md has an explicit "WHEN TO IGNORE BENCHMARKS" section for when not to trust them
- **Not a dark patterns toolkit** -- flags anti-patterns, prioritizes user trust
- **Not affiliated** with Adapty, RevenueCat, Superwall, AppsFlyer, Apphud, or Apple

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap — Framework Expansion

Paywall is the **flagship domain**. Framework will expand into adjacent subscription-app domains. Full detail in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

| Priority | Domain | Status | Release |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| — | **Paywall** | ✅ Production (v4.0, flagship domain) | Shipped |
| 1 | **Onboarding** (patterns, copy, teardowns, compliance, metrics) | 📋 Planned | v5.0 |
| 2 | **Retention & Lifecycle** (habit loops, streaks, churn prevention, dunning) | 📋 Planned | v6.0 |
| 3 | **Growth & Acquisition** (ASO, ASA, paid UA, web2app, attribution) | 📋 Planned | v7.0 |
| 4 | **Pricing Strategy** (as standalone domain; tier design, dynamic pricing) | 📋 Planned | v8.0 |
| 5 | **Reviews & Reputation** (prompt timing, recovery flows) | 📋 Planned | v9.0 |

The 20-concept academic foundation (Kahneman + Layer 2) already applies cross-domain — it's in the **shared** layer. Each new domain gets its own modules while inheriting the foundations.

**Non-goals:** generic web CRO, enterprise B2B sales, original academic research, competing with vendor SDKs. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for full scope.

---

## What's New

- **v4.0.0** (current): **Reframed as Framework.** Positioning upgraded from "single Claude skill" to "4-layer framework" (Skill + Knowledge + Tool + Reference). New [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) documents planned expansion to Onboarding, Retention, Growth, Pricing, Reviews domains. No breaking changes — all v3.x installations continue to work.
- **v3.8.0**: **Academic foundation Layer 2.** Added 9 additional rigorous behavioral-science concepts to pricing-psychology.md beyond the Kahneman base — Fogg B=MAT, Iyengar Choice Overload (jam study), IKEA Effect, Hyperbolic Discounting (Laibson), Goal-Gradient (Kivetz), Negativity Bias (Baumeister 2001), Costly Signaling (Spence/Nobel), Reactance Theory (Brehm), Sunk Cost (Arkes & Blumer). Plus explicit warning on ego-depletion replication failure (Hagger 2016 + Vohs 2016 multi-lab studies). 11 new sources.json academic entries. Total academic concepts: 20.
- **v3.7.0**: **Kahneman foundation expansion.** Added 11 Kahneman concepts to pricing-psychology.md, each mapped to a specific paywall design choice: Prospect Theory & Loss Aversion, Anchoring (1974), System 1/2, Endowment Effect, Peak-End Rule, Default Effect, Mental Accounting, WYSIATI, Substitution Heuristic, Planning Fallacy, Hedonic Adaptation. Cross-referenced from copy-library, decision-trees, screen-anatomy, glossary. 11 new sources.json entries (academic class).
- **v3.6.0**: Data refresh — ChatGPT teardown updated to current 6-tier pricing structure (Free/Go/Plus/Pro/Business/Enterprise) without model-version trivia. Redesigned README header with concrete jobs-to-be-done table.
- **v3.5.0**: Phase 3 — refund management, cohort analysis, audit checklist, migration playbooks, worked examples (3 categories), CI validation.
- **v3.4.0**: Phase 2 — onboarding-paywall handoff, lifecycle messaging, glossary, executable Python LTV calculator.
- **v3.3.0**: Phase 1 — unit-economics calculator, indie dev FAQ, CAC + acquisition module, response modes.
- **v3.2.0**: Initial modular split + AppsFlyer + academic foundations + 11 big-app teardowns.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Ground rules:

1. **Every benchmark needs a source and date.** No unsourced numbers.
2. **Label every recommendation** with its evidence level (Apple Rule through Hypothesis).
3. **Check against App Store guidelines** before adding UI patterns.
4. **Keep SKILL.md lean** -- put deep content in a module under `modules/` and reference from SKILL.md. Every line in the core costs tokens for every user.
5. **Open an issue first** for structural changes.
