### Just Describe What You Want

Skills activate automatically — no manual invocation needed:

| Say this... | Skill that activates |
|-------------|---------------------|
| "Review my code for best practices" | `ios/coding-best-practices` or `macos/coding-best-practices` |
| "Review my UI for HIG" | `ios/ui-review` or `macos/ui-review-tahoe` |
| "Add logging to my app" | `generators/logging-setup` |
| "Add subscription paywall" | `generators/paywall-generator` |
| "TDD this new feature" | `testing/tdd-feature` |
| "Fix this bug and add a test" | `testing/tdd-bug-fix` |
| "I need to refactor this safely" | `testing/tdd-refactor-guard` |
| "Should I monetize my app?" | `monetization` |
| "Review for release" | `release-review` |
| "I have an app idea..." | `product/product-agent` |

## Common Workflows

### New App

```
You: "I have an idea for a macOS app that does X"
→ product/product-agent validates the idea
→ product/market-research sizes the market
→ product/prd-generator creates the PRD
→ generators/ add features as you build
→ release-review/ audits before shipping
```

### Existing App — Add Features

```
You: "Add CloudKit sync to my app"
→ generators/cloudkit-sync generates the code
→ testing/tdd-feature helps you test it
```

### Existing App — Safe Refactoring

```
You: "I need to refactor my data layer"
→ testing/tdd-refactor-guard checks test coverage
→ testing/characterization-test-generator captures current behavior
→ You refactor with confidence
```

### Bug Fix

```
You: "Users report X is broken"
→ testing/tdd-bug-fix writes failing test first
→ Fix + verify + never regress
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific

```
Good: "Review ExpenseViewModel.swift for best practices"
Vague: "Check my code"
```

### Provide Context

```
Good: "Add a subscription paywall with monthly and yearly tiers"
Vague: "Add payments"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

1. Check skill is in `.claude/skills/` directory
2. Verify YAML front matter is valid: `head -5 .claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md`
3. Use explicit trigger phrases from the skill's "When This Skill Activates" section
4. Try: "Use the [skill-name] skill to review this"

### Wrong Skill Activates

- Be more specific in your request
- Skills auto-select based on keyword matching in their descriptions
