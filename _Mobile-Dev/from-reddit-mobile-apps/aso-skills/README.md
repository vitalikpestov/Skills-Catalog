AI agent skills for App Store Optimization (ASO) and mobile app marketing. Built for indie developers, app marketers, and growth teams who want **Cursor**, **Claude Code**, or any [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible AI assistant to help with keyword research, metadata optimization, competitor analysis, market intelligence, and app growth.

Powered by real App Store data via the [Appeeky API](https://docs.appeeky.com).

A web version is also available, powered by AI chats and our MCP: [Appeeky Web](https://appeeky.com).

## Why This Exists

Most ASO knowledge lives in blog posts, courses, and expensive consultants. We packaged it into skills that any AI agent can use — so you get expert-level ASO guidance directly in your IDE.

Each skill contains battle-tested frameworks, scoring rubrics, and output templates. The agent reads the skill, pulls real data from the App Store (via Appeeky), and gives you actionable recommendations — not generic advice.

## Quick Start

**Cursor** — Settings (Cmd+Shift+J) → Rules → Add Rule → Remote Rule (Github) → paste `https://github.com/eronred/aso-skills`

**Claude Code** — `npx skills add eronred/aso-skills`

**Manual** — `git clone https://github.com/eronred/aso-skills.git && cp -r aso-skills/skills/* .cursor/skills/`

Then ask your agent:

```
"Run an ASO audit for my app (id: 1617391485)"
"Find the best keywords for a meditation app"
"Optimize my App Store title and subtitle"
"How many downloads do I need to reach top 10 in Health & Fitness?"
"What apps are rising in the charts right now?"
"Give me a market briefing for the Games category"
"How are my downloads and revenue trending this month?"
"Help me plan a Christmas In-App Event"
"What seasonal keywords should I add in December?"
"Optimize my Google Play listing"
"My app rating dropped — how do I recover it?"
"Set up a weekly competitor monitoring routine for apps X, Y, Z"
"Help me pitch TechCrunch for my app launch"
"Build an Apple Search Ads campaign structure for my fitness app"
"My app has a crash affecting 2% of sessions — help me triage it"
```

**Don't want to remember 30 skill names?** Just use the router:

```
/aso-skill  →  routes your request to the right specialist skill automatically
```

Or invoke directly: `/aso-audit`, `/keyword-research`, `/metadata-optimization`, `/market-movers`, `/market-pulse`, `/asc-metrics`, `/in-app-events`, `/seasonal-aso`, `/android-aso`, `/apple-search-ads`, `/competitor-tracking`

## How It Works

```
You: "Run an ASO audit for Headspace"

Agent:
  1. Reads aso-audit/SKILL.md (framework, scoring rubric, output template)
  2. Calls Appeeky API → fetches metadata, keywords, ratings, competitors
  3. Scores each factor (title: 8/10, subtitle: 6/10, keywords: 4/10...)
  4. Returns: ASO Score Card + Quick Wins + High-Impact Changes + Strategic Recs
```

Skills reference each other — `aso-audit` might suggest running `keyword-research` for deeper analysis, which then feeds into `metadata-optimization` for implementation.

## Installation

### Cursor

| Method | Command |
|--------|---------|
| GitHub Import | Settings → Rules → Add Rule → Remote Rule → `https://github.com/eronred/aso-skills` |
| Project-level | `cp -r aso-skills/skills/* .cursor/skills/` |
| Global | `cp -r aso-skills/skills/* ~/.cursor/skills/` |

### Claude Code

| Method | Command |
|--------|---------|
| CLI | `npx skills add eronred/aso-skills` |
| Specific skills | `npx skills add eronred/aso-skills --skill aso-audit keyword-research` |
| Manual | `cp -r aso-skills/skills/* .claude/skills/` |

### Any Agent

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/eronred/aso-skills.git .agents/aso-skills
```

Works with any tool that supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard (`.agents/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`).

## Appeeky Integration

Skills work standalone with general ASO knowledge. Connect [Appeeky](https://docs.appeeky.com/mcp) for real-time App Store data:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "appeeky": {
      "url": "https://mcp.appeeky.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer apk_your_key_here" }
    }
  }
}
```

With Appeeky connected, skills can pull live keyword rankings, competitor metadata, download estimates, trending keywords, and featured apps.

### Appeeky Connect — First-Party ASC Data

The `asc-metrics` skill uses **Appeeky Connect**, a new integration that syncs your exact App Store Connect data (downloads, revenue, subscriptions, trials, IAP, and country breakdowns) into Appeeky nightly.

Connect once at [appeeky.com → Settings → Integrations](https://appeeky.com) and then ask:

```
"How are my downloads trending this month?"
"What are my top 5 markets by revenue?"
"Compare this month's subscriptions to last month"
```

Requires Indie plan( coffee price: $8/month) or higher. See [tools/integrations/appeeky-connect.md](tools/integrations/appeeky-connect.md) for the full API reference.

See [tools/REGISTRY.md](tools/REGISTRY.md) for the full capability matrix.
