## Overview

A *transaction* represents a successful In-App Purchase. The App Store generates a transaction each time a customer purchases an In-App Purchase product or renews a subscription. For each transaction that represents a current purchase, your app unlocks the purchased content or service and finishes the transaction.

Use the `Transaction` type to perform these transaction-related tasks:

- Get the customer’s transaction history, latest transactions, and current entitlements to unlock content and services.
- Access transaction properties.
- Finish a transaction after your app delivers the purchased content or service.
- Access the raw JSON Web Signature (JWS) string and supporting values to verify the transaction information.
- Listen for new transactions while the app is running.
- Begin a refund request from within your app.

### Access transaction history and current entitlements

Your app doesn’t create transaction objects. Instead, StoreKit automatically makes up-to-date transactions available to your app, including when someone launches the app for the first time.

> **Related sessions from WWDC22:** Session 110404: [Implement proactive in-app purchase restore](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110404/)

You access transactions in several ways:

- Get transaction history anytime by accessing the static [all](/documentation/storekit/transaction/all) sequence, or get just the most recent transaction for a product with the [latestTransaction](/documentation/storekit/product/latesttransaction) property of [Product](/documentation/storekit/product).
- Receive notifications for new transactions while your app is running when customers complete a purchase outside of the app, including on another device, through the transaction listener, [updates](/documentation/storekit/transaction/updates).
- Access the latest transaction for a subscription group through the subscription status API, using [transaction](/documentation/storekit/product/subscriptioninfo/status-swift.struct/transaction).
- After a successful In-App Purchase, StoreKit returns the transaction through [Product.PurchaseResult.success(_:)](/documentation/storekit/product/purchaseresult/success(_:)).

The most important use of transaction information is for determining which In-App Purchases the customer has paid access to, so your app can unlock the content or service. The [currentEntitlements](/documentation/storekit/transaction/currententitlements) API provides the information you need to unlock all of the customer’s paid content in your app. Use `currentEntitlements` to get a list of transactions for all the products the customer is currently entitled to, including non-consumable In-App Purchases and currently active subscriptions.

### Verify transactions

The App Store cryptographically signs transaction information in JWS format. StoreKit automatically validates and returns the signed information, wrapped in a [VerificationResult](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult). When the `VerificationResult` wraps a `Transaction` value, it provides the raw JWS string in the [jwsRepresentation](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-21vgo) property. If you get a transaction through [VerificationResult.verified(_:)](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult/verified(_:)), the information passed validation. If you get it through [VerificationResult.unverified(_:_:)](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult/unverified(_:_:)), the information didn’t pass StoreKit’s automatic validation. Your app can immediately access the transaction information in the [Transaction properties](/documentation/storekit/transaction-properties).

To perform your own validation on the device, use the verification result’s [jwsRepresentation](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-21vgo) string, and use the provided convenience properties [headerData](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult/headerdata-9egfp), [payloadData](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult/payloaddata-uyle), and [signatureData](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult/signaturedata-4pyv8). For added control and security, send the `jwsRepresentation` to your server to verify. Consider using the App Store Server Library to implement your verification. The library provides the functions `verifyAndDecodeTransaction` and `verifyAndDecodeRenewalInfo` in each language the library supports. For more information, see [Simplifying your implementation by using the App Store Server Library](/documentation/AppStoreServerAPI/simplifying-your-implementation-by-using-the-app-store-server-library).

> **Tip:** The [jwsRepresentation](/documentation/storekit/verificationresult/jwsrepresentation-21vgo) is the same as the [JWSTransaction](/documentation/AppStoreServerAPI/JWSTransaction) that the [App Store Server API](/documentation/AppStoreServerAPI) returns and to the [JWSTransaction](/documentation/AppStoreServerNotifications/JWSTransaction) that you receive in [App Store Server Notifications V2](/documentation/AppStoreServerNotifications/App-Store-Server-Notifications-V2). You can validate them on your server in the same way.

If StoreKit returns a transaction as verified, the transaction is valid for the device. For information about performing your own verification for a device, see [deviceVerification](/documentation/storekit/transaction/deviceverification).

For more information about JWS, see the [IETF RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) specification.

### Access purchases made with the original API

All In-App Purchases that customers make are equally available to your app in this `Transaction` API, and in receipts using the [Original API for In-App Purchase](/documentation/storekit/original-api-for-in-app-purchase), as follows:

- New purchases that customers make with the original API are available immediately using the `Transaction` API.
- Purchases that customers make with the [purchase(options:)](/documentation/storekit/product/purchase(options:)) method are available in the original API when your app refreshes the receipt. For more information, see [SKReceiptRefreshRequest](/documentation/storekit/skreceiptrefreshrequest).
