> A type that sets a tip’s content, as well as the conditions for when it displays.

```swift
protocol Tip : Identifiable, Sendable
```

## Overview

Use this protocol for setting a tip’s content, as well as defining the conditions for when it appears in a view. You create custom tips by declaring types that conform to the `Tip` protocol. Set your tip’s content by giving it a [title](/documentation/tipkit/tip/title),  [message](/documentation/tipkit/tip/message),  [image](/documentation/tipkit/tip/image), and a list of [actions](/documentation/tipkit/tip/actions).

For example, to create a tip with a `title`, `message`, and `image`:

```swift
struct FavoriteBackyardTip: Tip {
    var title: Text {
        Text("Save as a Favorite")
    }

    var message: Text? {
        Text("Your favorite backyards always appear at the top of the list.")
    }

    var image: Image? {
        Image(systemName: "star")
    }
}
```

For a tip to be valid, you need to set its `title`. To control when a tip displays, pass instances of [Rule](/documentation/tipkit/tip/rule) and [Option](/documentation/tipkit/tip/option) into the [rules](/documentation/tipkit/tip/rules) and [options](/documentation/tipkit/tip/options) properties of the tip.

After you define your tip’s content, display it in either a [TipView](/documentation/tipkit/tipview) or a [popoverTip(_:arrowEdge:action:)](/documentation/SwiftUI/View/popoverTip(_:arrowEdge:action:)).
