## Overview

Use a [HKHealthStore](/documentation/healthkit/hkhealthstore) object to request permission to share or read HealthKit data. After you have permission, you can use the HealthKit store to save new samples to the store, or to manage the samples that your app saved. Additionally, you can use the HealthKit store to start, stop, and manage queries.

For more information, see [Setting up HealthKit](/documentation/healthkit/setting-up-healthkit).
