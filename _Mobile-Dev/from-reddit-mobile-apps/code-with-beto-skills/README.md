## Available Plugins

### 🎨 App Icon Plugin

AI-powered app icon generation with full iOS 26 Liquid Glass support and Android adaptive icons.

**Features:**

- Generate professional app icons using AI (powered by OpenAI via SnapAI CLI)
- Full iOS 26 `.icon` folder format with Liquid Glass effect support

### 🚀 Ship Plugin

Scaffold production-ready React Native apps from Code with Beto templates using the `@codewithbeto/ship` CLI.

**Features:**

- One-command project scaffolding with `bunx @codewithbeto/ship`
- Pre-configured RevenueCat payments integration
- Automatic app name, bundle ID, and slug configuration
- Dependency installation and git initialization out of the box
- Non-interactive flag-based mode for AI agent compatibility

**Use cases:**

- Ship a revenue-ready AI image app this weekend
- Skip boilerplate and start building features immediately
- Scaffold from the battle-tested Platano template
- Automate project creation in CI or with AI agents

### 🛠 Local Build Plugin

Generate release `.apk` and simulator `.app` artifacts for your Expo project using `gradlew` and `xcodebuild` directly.

**Features:**

- Reads your `app.config.ts` / `app.json` to pull app name, slug, scheme, and bundle identifier
- Verifies the iOS scheme on disk so the build command matches what Xcode generated
- Writes `scripts/build-android.sh` and `scripts/build-ios.sh` with your real values baked in
- Copies each artifact into `builds/` (replacing the previous one) for predictable install paths
- Defaults to **Release** to avoid the `expo-dev-client` launcher screen

**Use cases:**

- Producing APKs and `.app` bundles for e2e tests (Maestro, Detox)
- Sharing a real build with a teammate without spinning up a dev server
- Iterating on a local device or simulator without waiting on remote builds

## How It Works

These skills integrate with Claude Code to provide contextual, automated workflows. When you describe what you need, Claude will:

1. Detect which skill is relevant to your task
2. Execute the appropriate workflow automatically
3. Handle configuration, file generation, and setup
4. Provide clear instructions for testing and next steps

No manual configuration needed - just describe what you want to build.
