Android Skills MCP wraps Google's [`android/skills`](https://github.com/android/skills) library so any AI coding assistant can use it without copy and paste. The repository ships two tools that share a common parser and a bundled snapshot of the upstream skills, so both work offline through `npx`.

You get an MCP server that exposes the skill library to any MCP capable client, and a packager CLI that converts each `SKILL.md` into the native rules format of every major AI coding assistant.

Full documentation lives at **[skydoves.github.io/android-skills-mcp](https://skydoves.github.io/android-skills-mcp/)**.

## Packages

This is a pnpm workspace with three packages:

- **[`android-skills-mcp`](packages/mcp)** is an MCP server. It speaks stdio, ships three tools (`list_skills`, `search_skills`, `get_skill`), and exposes every skill as a `skill://` resource. Any MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Windsurf) can discover and pull the right skill on demand.
- **[`android-skills-pack`](packages/pack)** is a CLI. It converts the upstream `SKILL.md` files into seven native rules formats (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini Code Assist, JetBrains Junie, Continue.dev, Aider) and writes them into your project.
- **[`@android-skills/core`](packages/core)** is the shared library used by both. It parses `SKILL.md` frontmatter with `gray-matter`, validates against the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) spec via `zod`, and builds a BM25 index with `minisearch`.

## How to install the MCP server

You need this once per machine. Every project you open afterwards can use the skills.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add android-skills -- npx -y android-skills-mcp
```

### Cursor

Add an entry to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "android-skills": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "android-skills-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP clients

Anywhere you can register an MCP server with a stdio command, run:

```
npx -y android-skills-mcp
```

The bundled snapshot loads in under 200 ms, so the cost of spawning the server per session is negligible.

## How to install skills as files

If you prefer rules files committed to your repository over an MCP server, the packager CLI writes them directly. You can pick a single target or `all`:

```bash
npx android-skills-pack install --target cursor
npx android-skills-pack install --target claude-code
npx android-skills-pack install --target copilot
npx android-skills-pack install --target all
```

You can also filter to a specific skill:

```bash
npx android-skills-pack install --target cursor --skill edge-to-edge
npx android-skills-pack install --target claude-code --skill edge-to-edge,r8-analyzer
```

The full list of supported targets:

| Target | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Near 1:1 copy with references kept as separate files. |
| `cursor` | `.cursor/rules/<name>.mdc` | `description` plus `alwaysApply: false` frontmatter; references inlined. |
| `copilot` | `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md` | `applyTo: "**"` frontmatter. |
| `gemini` | `.gemini/styleguide.md` | Single concatenated file with `## <skill>` sections. |
| `junie` | `.junie/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | JetBrains Junie supports the agentskills.io spec natively. |
| `continue` | `.continue/rules/<name>.md` | `name`, `description`, `alwaysApply` frontmatter. |
| `aider` | `CONVENTIONS.md` (repo root) | Single file. Add `read: CONVENTIONS.md` to `.aider.conf.yml`. |

## Repository layout

```
android-mcp/
├── packages/
│   ├── core/   @android-skills/core   parser, schema, search index
│   ├── mcp/    android-skills-mcp     MCP server (stdio)
│   └── pack/   android-skills-pack    packager CLI
├── scripts/    sync-skills.mjs, build-skills-index.mjs
└── skills/     upstream android/skills clone (gitignored)
```

The `skills/` directory is a plain clone of `android/skills` and is gitignored. You only need it for development. Both published packages bundle a parsed snapshot of the skills inside `dist/skills.json`, so end users never need the upstream repository.

## Development

Clone, install, and run the test suite:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skydoves/android-skills-mcp.git
cd android-mcp
pnpm install
pnpm sync:skills
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

The build runs in topological order: `core` first, then `mcp` and `pack` in parallel. Each package has its own `vitest` suite. The full test count is 64 across the three packages.

You can smoke test the MCP server over stdio without any client:

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"smoke","version":"0"}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}' \
  | node packages/mcp/dist/bin.js
```
