> [!WARNING]
> **Marketplace layout changed in the 2026-05-06 refactor.** Skills now live only inside self-contained plugin bundles under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/`. The root `shared/` directory is maintainer-only source material for files reused by 2+ skills; runtime installs use the copied skill-local `references/` files.

> **7 plugins. Two native marketplaces.** Install only what you need and automate your full delivery workflow —
> from project bootstrap to code audit to production quality gates.
> Works standalone or as a complete Agile pipeline.

> [!TIP]
> **Two-Agent AI Review** — Claude and Codex can review each other’s work through host-aware external advisor routing.

Browse and discover individual skills at [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/LevNikolaevich/claude-code-skills).

> [!NOTE]
> **skills.sh is a showcase only.** The supported install path is the Claude or Codex marketplace plugin flow above. Plugin bundles are self-contained; root `shared/` is not a runtime dependency.

---

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex)

```bash
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add levnikolaevich/claude-code-skills
/plugin install setup-environment@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace

# Codex CLI
codex plugin marketplace add levnikolaevich/claude-code-skills
codex
/plugins
```

Verify: run `ln-010-dev-environment-setup`

---

## Quick Start

**Standalone** (works immediately, no setup):
```bash
ln-010-dev-environment-setup  # Set up agents, MCP, and marketplace plugins
ln-620-codebase-auditor       # Audit your code for issues
ln-100-documents-pipeline     # Generate documentation
```

**Full Agile workflow** (Linear, GitHub Issues, or File Mode — chosen during ln-010 setup, persisted in `.hex-skills/environment_state.json`):
```bash
ln-200-scope-decomposer    # Scope -> Epics -> Stories
ln-1000-pipeline-orchestrator  # Artifact-driven pipeline: tasks → validation → execution → quality gate
```

**Manual step-by-step** (if you prefer control over each stage):
```bash
ln-400-story-executor      # Execute Story tasks
ln-500-story-quality-gate  # Quality gate + test planning
```

---

## Workflow

```
ln-010-dev-environment-setup    # 0. Set up dev environment (once)
         ↓
ln-100-documents-pipeline       # 1. Documentation
         ↓
ln-200-scope-decomposer         # 2. Scope -> Epics -> Stories
         ↓
ln-1000-pipeline-orchestrator   # 3. Full artifact-driven pipeline: 300 → 310 → 400 → 500 → Done
```

Coordinators keep lifecycle status separate from Loop Health: `status` says where the run is, artifacts/checkpoints prove completion, and `loop_health` decides whether another retry is useful. Procedural skills use SOP/TWI-style point-of-use checklists so risky steps carry action, key point, why, evidence, exception, and guard close to the moment of use.

---


## MCP Servers (Optional)

Bundled MCP servers extend agent capabilities — hash-verified editing, code intelligence, remote access, and research graph navigation. All skills work without MCP (fallback to built-in tools), but MCP servers improve accuracy and save tokens. MCP errors stay as `status: "ERROR"` and include `failure_class`, `next_action`, and recovery fields so skills can feed transport/tool/auth/rate-limit signals into Loop Health without inventing a second retry loop.

### Bundled servers

| Server | What it does | Tools | Docs |
|--------|-------------|-------|------|
| **[hex-line-mcp](mcp/hex-line-mcp/)** | Every line carries a content hash — edits prove the agent sees current content. Prevents stale-context corruption. Includes validation hooks. | 9 | [README](mcp/hex-line-mcp/README.md) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@levnikolaevich/hex-line-mcp) |
| **[hex-graph-mcp](mcp/hex-graph-mcp/)** | Indexes codebases into a deterministic SQLite graph with framework-aware overlays, capability-first quality tooling, optional SCIP interop, and architecture/reference analysis. | 14 | [README](mcp/hex-graph-mcp/README.md) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@levnikolaevich/hex-graph-mcp) |
| **[hex-ssh-mcp](mcp/hex-ssh-mcp/)** | Hash-verified remote file editing and SFTP transfer over SSH. Normalized output for minimal token usage. | 8 | [README](mcp/hex-ssh-mcp/README.md) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@levnikolaevich/hex-ssh-mcp) |
| **[hex-research-mcp](mcp/hex-research-mcp/)** | Indexes markdown hypotheses, goals, tasks, sources, and benchmark manifests into a local SQLite research graph. | 15 | [README](mcp/hex-research-mcp/README.md) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@levnikolaevich/hex-research-mcp) |

Deterministic scope rule: `hex-line`, `hex-graph`, and `hex-research` keep `path` as the project anchor. In normal use the agent fills it automatically from the active file or project root, so users usually do not need to type it manually. `hex-research` writes its local index under `.hex-skills/researchgraph/`. `hex-ssh` runs on Windows/macOS/Linux hosts; remote shell tools stay POSIX-oriented, while SFTP transfers support platform-aware remote paths.

<!-- GENERATED:HEX_GRAPH_MCP_STATUS:START -->
`hex-graph-mcp` quality snapshot: `106/106` tests passing, `1` curated corpus, `1` pinned external corpora, parser-first `green`.
<!-- GENERATED:HEX_GRAPH_MCP_STATUS:END -->

### External servers

| Server | Purpose | API Key | Used by |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **[Context7](https://context7.com)** | Library docs, APIs, migration guides | Optional ([dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard)) | ln-310, ln-511, ln-640+ |
| **[Ref](https://docs.ref.tools/install)** | Standards, RFCs, best practices | Required ([ref.tools/keys](https://ref.tools/keys)) | ln-310, ln-511, ln-640+ |
| **[Linear](https://linear.app/docs/mcp)** | Issue tracking (Agile workflow) | OAuth via browser | ln-300+, ln-400+, ln-500+ |

**CLI setup:**
```bash
# hex-line — hash-verified file editing (bundled)
claude mcp add -s user hex-line -- npx -y @levnikolaevich/hex-line-mcp

# hex-ssh — token-efficient SSH with hash verification (bundled)
claude mcp add -s user hex-ssh -- npx -y @levnikolaevich/hex-ssh-mcp

# hex-graph — code knowledge graph (bundled)
claude mcp add -s user hex-graph -- npx -y @levnikolaevich/hex-graph-mcp

# hex-research — research hypothesis graph (bundled)
claude mcp add -s user hex-research -- npx -y @levnikolaevich/hex-research-mcp

# Context7 — library documentation (HTTP, optional API key)
claude mcp add -s user --transport http --header "CONTEXT7_API_KEY: YOUR_KEY" context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp

# Ref — standards & best practices (HTTP, API key required)
claude mcp add -s user --transport http --header "x-ref-api-key: YOUR_KEY" Ref https://api.ref.tools/mcp

# Linear — issue tracking (HTTP, OAuth via browser)
claude mcp add -s user --transport http linear-server https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
```


### Agent steering

MCP servers can be installed correctly and still lose to built-ins in practice. `hex-line-mcp` keeps Claude aligned through one output style and five Claude hook events:

| Mechanism | How it works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[Output style](mcp/hex-line-mcp/output-style.md)** | Injected into system prompt — maps built-in tools to MCP equivalents (`Read` → `hex-line read_file`, `Edit` → `hex-line edit_file`) |
| **SessionStart hook** | Injects a compact bootstrap hint and defers to the active `hex-line` output style when present |
| **PreToolUse hook** | Hard-redirects project text `Read`/`Edit`/`Write`/`Grep`/`Glob`, redirects Bash file-inspection commands, blocks dangerous commands, enforces plan mode for mutating MCP tools |
| **PostToolUse hook** | Filters verbose Bash output (50+ lines): normalize, deduplicate, truncate to first 15 + last 15 lines |
| **ConfigChange hook** | Invalidates cached state when settings change mid-session |
| **PermissionDenied hook** | Observability: logs when Claude denies a tool call after redirect hint |

Hooks and output style auto-sync on `hex-line-mcp` startup. First run after install performs the initial sync automatically.

## AI Review Models (Optional)

Review uses two CLI agents: Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. The active host does not call itself as the advisor; Claude-hosted runs delegate to Codex, while Codex-hosted runs delegate to Claude.

| Model | CLI | Version | Used by | Settings |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|----------|
| **[Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex)** | `codex` | user config | ln-310, ln-510, ln-813 | `codex exec --full-auto` |
| **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** | `claude` | user config | ln-310, ln-510, ln-813 | `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` |

**Review Workflow:**
1. **Host-aware routing** — choose the other CLI as external advisor
2. **Critical verification** — the host agent validates each suggestion before accepting it
3. **Filtering** — only supported, high-impact suggestions surface
4. **Fallback** — self-review if the external advisor is unavailable

**Installation:**
```bash
# Codex (OpenAI)
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login

# Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude auth login
```

**Configuration:**
Review agents use the prompt templates and schemas copied into each skill's local `references/agents/` directory. No manual setup required.

**Audit Trail:**
All prompts/results saved to `.agent-review/{agent}/` for transparency:
```
.agent-review/
├── codex/
│   ├── PROJ-123_storyreview_prompt.md
│   ├── PROJ-123_storyreview_result.md
│   └── PROJ-123_session.json
└── claude/
    └── (same structure)
```

Additional configured agents use the same per-agent directory structure.

<details>
<summary><b>Skills using external AI review</b></summary>

- **ln-310-multi-agent-validator** — Story/Tasks validation with host-aware Claude/Codex review
- **ln-510-quality-coordinator** — Code implementation review with host-aware Claude/Codex review
- **ln-813-optimization-plan-validator** — Optimization plan review before strike execution

All skills support:
- Session Resume for multi-round debates
- Zero timeout (wait for completion)
- Read-only analysis (no project modifications)
- Internet access for research

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Sharing skills & MCP between agents</b></summary>

**Install skills independently per agent.** Do not symlink one agent's plugin root into another agent's discovery root.

Claude Code uses `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Codex uses `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` plus per-plugin `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifests. Both surfaces point at the same plugin-first bundles under `plugins/*`; root `shared/` is a development-only canonical source for files reused by 2+ skills and is distributed into skill-local `references/` through `tools/marketplace/shared-registry.json`.

**MCP settings locations** (for manual sharing):

| Agent | Config File | Format | Docs |
|-------|------------|--------|------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/settings.json` | JSON (`mcpServers: {}`) | [docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/config.toml` | TOML (`[mcp_servers.name]`) | [docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp) |

**Note:** Claude and Codex use different config formats and native plugin flows. `ln-013-config-syncer` installs or verifies selected marketplace plugins independently for both agents, defaults to `agile-workflow`, and aligns MCP/policy settings non-destructively.

Add the marketplace once, then install only what you need.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it require Linear, GitHub, or any external dependencies?</b></summary>

No. All skills work without external trackers. Linear and GitHub Issues integrations are optional — you choose the tracker provider during `ln-010` setup, and the choice persists in `.hex-skills/environment_state.json`. File mode (local markdown + `kanban_board.md`) is always available with no API keys or paid services required.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use it on an existing project?</b></summary>

Yes. `ln-700-project-bootstrap` has a TRANSFORM mode that restructures existing projects to Clean Architecture without starting from scratch. Audit skills (`ln-6XX`) work standalone on any codebase — no setup required.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does it automate the Agile workflow?</b></summary>

Skills form a complete pipeline: `ln-700` bootstraps the project → `ln-100` generates documentation → `ln-200` decomposes scope into Epics and Stories → `ln-1000` drives `ln-300 -> ln-310 -> ln-400 -> ln-500` through coordinator stage artifacts. Task-plan, execution, quality, and test-planning workers are stateful and resumable, while coordinators make decisions only from machine-readable artifacts.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I run individual skills without the full pipeline?</b></summary>

Yes. Most skills work standalone — just invoke them directly (e.g., `/ln-620-codebase-auditor` for a full code audit). Pipeline orchestrators (`ln-1000`, `ln-400`, `ln-510`, `ln-520`) coordinate other skills but are not required, and their workers remain standalone-capable. In managed runs, coordinators pass deterministic `runId` and exact `summaryArtifactPath`; in standalone runs, workers create their own runtime state and summary path.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can it generate tests automatically?</b></summary>

Yes. `ln-520-test-planner` orchestrates the full test planning pipeline, `ln-523-auto-test-planner` creates risk-based test scenarios (E2E, integration, unit), and `ln-404-test-executor` implements test tasks. Manual testing is covered by `ln-522-manual-tester` with executable bash scripts. Run `ln-630-test-auditor` to audit an existing test suite across 7 categories.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does it handle "almost right" AI-generated code?</b></summary>

Through automated review loops. `ln-402-task-reviewer` checks every task output, `ln-403-task-rework` fixes issues and resubmits for review, and `ln-500-story-quality-gate` runs a 4-level gate (PASS/CONCERNS/FAIL/WAIVED) before any Story is marked Done. Code is never shipped without passing quality checks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it replace human code review?</b></summary>

No — it augments human review. Claude/Codex cross-checking catches issues before human reviewers see the code. Human approval points are built into the workflow at Story validation (`ln-310`) and quality gates (`ln-500`). The goal is to reduce reviewer burden, not eliminate oversight.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can it catch technical debt from AI-generated code?</b></summary>

Yes. Audit skills specifically target AI-induced tech debt: `ln-623` checks DRY/KISS/YAGNI violations, `ln-626` finds dead code and unused imports, `ln-640` audits architectural pattern evolution, `ln-644` detects dependency cycles and coupling metrics, `ln-645` finds obsolete custom architecture mechanisms, and `ln-646` validates physical project structure. Run `ln-620-codebase-auditor` to scan all 9 categories in parallel.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What can the audit skills detect?</b></summary>

Audit skills in 5 groups: documentation quality (structure, semantics, fact-checking, inline code documentation), codebase health (security boundaries, delivery gates, DRY/KISS/YAGNI, maintainability hotspots, dependency/reuse risk, dead code, diagnosability, concurrency, lifecycle/config), test suites (business logic, E2E coverage, value scoring, coverage gaps, isolation, manual test quality, test structure), architecture (patterns, layer ownership, API contracts, dependency topology, modernization, project structure, configuration boundaries), and persistence performance (query efficiency, transactions, runtime, resource lifecycle).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does it handle multi-stack or polyglot projects?</b></summary>

Bootstrap skills (`ln-7XX`) support React, .NET, and Python project structures. Audit skills are language-aware — `ln-622-build-delivery-gate-auditor` checks compiler/type errors across stacks, `ln-625-dependency-reuse-auditor` scans npm, NuGet, and pip packages, and `ln-651-query-efficiency-auditor` catches N+1 queries regardless of ORM.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What AI models does it use?</b></summary>

The active host model performs orchestration and verification. For code and story reviews, skills can delegate to the other CLI agent: Claude-hosted runs use Codex as advisor, while Codex-hosted runs use Claude as advisor.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What MCP servers are included?</b></summary>

Four bundled MCP servers are published on npm: `hex-line-mcp` (hash-verified file editing), `hex-graph-mcp` (code knowledge graph), `hex-ssh-mcp` (hash-verified remote editing and SFTP over SSH), and `hex-research-mcp` (markdown research graph indexing). Skills work without MCP servers (fallback to built-in tools), but MCP improves edit accuracy and reduces token usage. See [MCP Servers](#mcp-servers-optional) for setup.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is hash-verified editing and why does it matter?</b></summary>

Every line `hex-line-mcp` reads carries a content hash. When the agent edits, it must reference these hashes — proving it sees current file content, not a stale version from earlier in the conversation. This eliminates a common failure mode where AI agents overwrite recent changes with outdated context. Hooks auto-steer Claude from built-in tools to `hex-line` equivalents so the protection is always active.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does it maintain context across large codebases?</b></summary>

Through the Orchestrator-Worker pattern plus persisted runtime state. Instead of feeding the entire codebase into one prompt, orchestrators advance stages from coordinator artifacts, coordinators consume worker artifacts, and workers execute with minimal, targeted context. Each layer loads only the files it needs and can resume from checkpoints instead of replaying long chat history.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How much context/tokens does it use?</b></summary>

Skills are designed for token efficiency. Each worker loads only the files it needs via targeted context — no full-codebase prompts. Orchestrators advance stages from machine-readable artifacts instead of replaying chat history, and workers resume from checkpoints instead of reprocessing. See [TOKEN_EFFICIENCY_PATTERNS.md](docs/standards/TOKEN_EFFICIENCY_PATTERNS.md) for the patterns used.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I customize or create my own skills?</b></summary>

Yes. Skills are `SKILL.md` files under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>/`. Single-skill support files live in that skill's `references/`; reusable shared resources live in root `shared/` and are copied into exact skill-local targets listed in `tools/marketplace/shared-registry.json` with `node tools/marketplace/shared.mjs sync`. Validate with `node tools/marketplace/validate.mjs`. Reusable capabilities should use the plugin-first skill structure. See [SKILL_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md](docs/architecture/SKILL_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md) for the development workflow, shared-resource rules, 4-level hierarchy (L0 -> L1 -> L2 -> L3), and writing guidelines.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use these skills with OpenAI Codex?</b></summary>

Yes. Claude and Codex have separate native marketplace surfaces in this repo. Install each agent independently through its own plugin flow; do not expose both surfaces to the same runtime at once. See [AI Review Models > Sharing skills & MCP between agents](#ai-review-models-optional) for config paths.
