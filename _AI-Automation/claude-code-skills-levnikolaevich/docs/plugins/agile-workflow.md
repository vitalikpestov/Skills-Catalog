# Agile Workflow

> End-to-end delivery pipeline from scope decomposition to quality gates

## Install

```bash
# Add the marketplace once
/plugin marketplace add levnikolaevich/claude-code-skills

# Install this plugin
/plugin install agile-workflow@levnikolaevich-skills-marketplace
```

## What it does

Automates the full Agile delivery cycle. Coordinators advance only from machine-readable artifacts, while task-plan, execution, quality, and test-planning workers keep their own runtime state and stay standalone-capable. Loop Health prevents same-error and no-progress retry storms without changing lifecycle statuses. Integrates with Linear or works standalone with markdown files.

## How it works

```
ln-200 (scope) -> ln-300 (tasks) -> ln-310 (validate)
    -> ln-400 (execute: ln-401/402/403/404)
    -> ln-500 (quality gate)
```

`ln-220`, `ln-300`, `ln-400`, `ln-510`, and `ln-520` keep coordinator runtime state and checkpoint child worker runs for resume. `ln-400` and `ln-1000` also record `loop_health` when an attempt repeats a task, worker, stage, error, or validation segment. `ln-221/222`, `ln-301/302`, `ln-401..404`, `ln-511..514`, and `ln-521..523` remain standalone-capable workers with their own run-scoped state and summaries. `ln-1000` advances only from coordinator stage artifacts, while `ln-310` runs registry-configured external-agent review before execution begins.

## Quick start

```bash
ln-200-scope-decomposer      # Scope -> Epics -> Stories
ln-400-story-executor         # Execute Story to Done
ln-1000-pipeline-orchestrator # Autonomous pipeline
```
