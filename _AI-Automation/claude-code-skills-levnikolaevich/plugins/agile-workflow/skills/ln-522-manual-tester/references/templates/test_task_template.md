## Risk Priority Matrix

**Priority Formula:** Priority = Business Impact (1-5) × Probability of Failure (1-5)

| Scenario | Business Impact | Probability | Priority | Test Type | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| [Scenario from manual testing] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-25] | E2E/Integration/Unit/SKIP | [Reason for decision] |
| [Scenario from manual testing] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-25] | E2E/Integration/Unit/SKIP | [Reason for decision] |

**Minimum Viable Testing Philosophy:**
- Start with baseline E2E tests per endpoint (positive + negative)
- Each additional test MUST pass all 6 Test Usefulness Criteria (see `references/risk_based_testing_guide.md`)
- No numerical targets — test count driven by risk assessment, not volume goals

**Principles:**
- ✅ Prioritize by business risk (money, security, data corruption) over coverage metrics
- ✅ Test OUR code ONLY (not frameworks/libraries/external systems/database queries)
- ✅ Anti-Duplication: If 2 baseline E2E cover logic, SKIP unit test
- ✅ Anti-Framework: If testing Prisma/Express/bcrypt behavior → SKIP
- ✅ Fast feedback: Unit (ms) → Integration (seconds) → E2E (tens of seconds)
- ✅ Non-Default Config: ALL configurable values (ports, timeouts, limits) MUST use non-default values to catch `value || DEFAULT` bugs
- ✅ Focus on critical paths (Priority ≥15), not blanket coverage

**Decision Criteria:**
- Priority ≥15 → MUST test (if tests OUR logic)
- Priority 9-14 → SHOULD test if not already covered AND tests OUR logic
- Priority ≤8 → SKIP (manual testing sufficient)

---

## E2E Tests

**BASELINE (ALWAYS):** Positive scenario (happy path) + Negative scenario (critical error) per endpoint

**ADDITIONAL:** ONLY if Priority ≥15 AND passes all 6 Test Usefulness Criteria

Test complete user journeys through the system. Each test beyond baseline MUST pass Usefulness Criteria: "Why does this test OUR business logic (not framework/library/database)?"

**Type:** [API E2E / UI E2E] *(depending on application type)*

### [Critical Scenario 1]: [User Journey Name] (Priority [XX])

**From Manual Testing:** [Link to AC or edge case in manual test results]

**Business Impact:** [1-5] - [Why critical: money/security/core flow]
**Probability of Failure:** [1-5] - [Why risky: complexity/external API/new tech]
**Priority:** [Business Impact × Probability] = [Result]

**Test Flow (copied from manual testing):**
1. **Setup:** [Initial state/preconditions from manual testing]
2. **Step 1:** [User action from curl/puppeteer] → **Verify:** [Expected result verified manually]
3. **Step 2:** [User action] → **Verify:** [Expected result]
4. **Step 3:** [User action] → **Verify:** [Final outcome]
5. **Cleanup:** [Teardown actions]

**Test:**
- [ ] `test_e2e_[scenario_name]` - Full journey from start to finish

**Anti-Duplication Check:**
- ✅ This E2E test is necessary because: [Unique business value not covered by other tests]

### [Critical Scenario 2]: [User Journey Name] (Priority [XX])

**From Manual Testing:** [Link to AC or edge case]

**Business Impact:** [1-5]
**Probability of Failure:** [1-5]
**Priority:** [Result]

**Test Flow:**
1. **Setup:** [Initial state]
2. **Actions & Verifications:** [Step-by-step user journey]
3. **Cleanup:** [Teardown]

**Test:**
- [ ] `test_e2e_[scenario_name]` - Description

**Anti-Duplication Check:**
- ✅ This E2E test is necessary because: [Reason]

### Standards
- [ ] **BASELINE: Positive + negative E2E per endpoint - ALWAYS**
- [ ] **ADDITIONAL: ONLY with critical justification + passes Usefulness Criteria**
- [ ] All scenarios Priority ≥15
- [ ] **Each test beyond baseline has documented justification: "Why does this test OUR business logic?"**
- [ ] E2E tests run in < 2 minutes total
- [ ] Test against stable environment (staging/test)
- [ ] Based on ACTUAL manual testing results (not theoretical scenarios)
- [ ] Clean up test data after execution
- [ ] **No tests for framework/library/database behavior** (trust Prisma/Express/PostgreSQL)

---

## Integration Tests

**DEFAULT: 0 Integration tests** (baseline E2E covers full stack by default)

**ADD ONLY if:** E2E doesn't cover interaction completely AND Priority ≥15 AND critical justification provided

Test OUR business logic with REAL internal dependencies. **ONLY Priority ≥15 interactions NOT fully covered by baseline E2E.** Each integration test MUST pass Usefulness Criteria: "Why does this test OUR integration logic (not framework/library behavior)?"

### [Integration Point 1]: [Layer Interaction] (Priority [XX])

**Scope:** [Layer A] → [Layer B] → [Layer C] (e.g., API → Service → Repository → DB)

**Why Integration Test Needed:**
- E2E test covers happy path, but need to verify: [Transaction rollback / Error handling / Concurrency]
- Business Impact: [1-5] - [Reason]
- Probability: [1-5] - [Reason]
- Priority: [Result]

**Tests:**
- [ ] `test_[flow]_integration` - Verifies complete data flow through layers
  - **Given:** [Setup: real DB with test data]
  - **When:** [Action: call Layer A]
  - **Then:** [Verify: data correctly flows and persists in DB]

**Use Real:**
- Database (test instance)
- Filesystem (temp directory)
- Internal services

**Use Mocks:**
- External API calls
- Email/SMS services
- Payment gateways

**Anti-Duplication Check:**
- ✅ This integration test adds value because: [E2E doesn't test error scenario / E2E doesn't test concurrent requests]

### [Integration Point 2]: [Description] (Priority [XX])

**Scope:** [Description of integration]

**Why Integration Test Needed:**
- [Reason E2E insufficient]
- Priority: [Result]

**Tests:**
- [ ] `test_[integration_scenario]` - What interaction this verifies

**Anti-Duplication Check:**
- ✅ Adds value because: [Reason]

### Standards
- [ ] **DEFAULT: 0 Integration tests** (baseline E2E covers full stack)
- [ ] Each integration test passes Usefulness Criteria
- [ ] All scenarios Priority ≥15
- [ ] **Each integration test has documented justification: "Why does this test OUR integration logic?"**
- [ ] Use test database (not production)
- [ ] Clean up after each test (rollback/truncate)
- [ ] All integration tests run in < 30 seconds total
- [ ] Skip if baseline E2E already validates end-to-end
- [ ] **No tests for framework/library integrations** (Prisma client, TypeORM, Express app behavior)

---

## Unit Tests

**DEFAULT: 0 Unit tests** (baseline E2E covers simple logic by default)

**ADD ONLY for:** Complex business logic with Priority ≥15 AND critical justification provided

Test individual components in isolation with all dependencies mocked. **ONLY complex business logic with Priority ≥15.** Each unit test MUST justify: "Why does this test OUR complex business logic (not library/framework/database behavior)?"

**MANDATORY SKIP - DO NOT create unit tests for:**
- ❌ Simple CRUD operations (already covered by 2 baseline E2E)
- ❌ Framework code (Express middleware, React hooks, FastAPI dependencies)
- ❌ Library functions (bcrypt hashing, jsonwebtoken signing, axios requests)
- ❌ Database queries (Prisma findMany, TypeORM query builder, SQL joins)
- ❌ Getters/setters or simple property access
- ❌ Trivial conditionals (`if (user) return user.name`, `status === 'active'`)
- ❌ Pass-through functions (wrappers without logic)
- ❌ Performance/load testing (throughput, latency, stress tests, scalability)

### [Component/Module Name 1]: [Complex Business Logic Function] (Priority [XX])

**File:** `path/to/component`

**Why Unit Test Needed:**
- Function: [Financial calculation / Security logic / Complex algorithm]
- Business Impact: [1-5] - [Money/Security/Data]
- Probability: [1-5] - [Complexity/Edge cases]
- Priority: [Result]

**Business scenarios to test:**
- [ ] `test_[function]_happy_path` - Main business scenario
- [ ] `test_[function]_edge_case_[discovered_in_manual_testing]` - Edge case from manual testing (Priority ≥9)
- [ ] `test_[function]_error_handling_[business_impact_4_or_5]` - Error with high business impact

**Mocks needed:**
- [Dependency 1]: Mock behavior
- [Dependency 2]: Mock behavior

**Anti-Duplication Check:**
- ✅ E2E doesn't fully exercise: [Edge case X / Error condition Y]

### [Component/Module Name 2]: [Another Complex Function] (Priority [XX])

**File:** `path/to/component`

**Why Unit Test Needed:**
- [Reason - complexity/business impact]
- Priority: [Result]

**Business scenarios to test:**
- [ ] `test_[scenario]` - Description of what this test verifies and WHY (business value)

**Mocks needed:**
- [Dependency]: Mock behavior

**Anti-Duplication Check:**
- ✅ Not covered by E2E because: [Reason]

### Standards
- [ ] **DEFAULT: 0 Unit tests** (baseline E2E covers simple logic)
- [ ] Each unit test passes Usefulness Criteria
- [ ] **Each unit test has documented justification: "Why does this test OUR complex business logic?"**
- [ ] All tests run in < 5 seconds total
- [ ] No external dependencies (DB, filesystem, network)
- [ ] Each test independent (can run in any order)
- [ ] Only test complex business logic (Priority ≥15): financial calculations, security algorithms, complex business rules
- [ ] Skip if baseline E2E already exercises all branches
- [ ] **No tests for library/framework/database behavior** (bcrypt, jwt, Prisma, axios)

## Critical Path Coverage

**Focus:** All Priority ≥15 scenarios tested, NOT blanket coverage percentage

**What MUST be tested (Priority ≥15):**
- [ ] All Acceptance Criteria from Story (verified in manual testing)
- [ ] Money-related scenarios (payments, refunds, pricing calculations)
- [ ] Security-critical flows (authentication, authorization, data access)
- [ ] Data integrity scenarios (transactions, rollbacks, concurrent updates)
- [ ] Core business flows (user cannot complete primary use case)
- [ ] High-risk edge cases discovered in manual testing (Priority ≥15)

**What SHOULD be tested (Priority 9-14) if not covered by E2E:**
- [ ] Medium-risk edge cases from manual testing
- [ ] Secondary business flows
- [ ] Error scenarios with Business Impact 3-4

**What to SKIP (Priority ≤8):**
- ❌ Simple CRUD operations (E2E covers these)
- ❌ Framework code (Express, React, Prisma)
- ❌ Third-party libraries (not our code)
- ❌ Trivial getters/setters
- ❌ Cosmetic bugs (color, spacing)
- ❌ Minor UX issues (button state)
- ❌ Scenarios already validated by manual testing with low business impact
- ❌ Performance/load testing (requires separate infrastructure and specialized tools)

**Coverage Expectations:**
- Coverage % is a metric, NOT a goal
- 40% coverage with 2 baseline E2E + Priority ≥15 scenarios tested → **ACCEPTABLE**
- 60% coverage with all Priority ≥15 scenarios tested → **EXCELLENT**
- 90% coverage but includes framework/library tests → **UNACCEPTABLE** (remove framework tests)
- 90% coverage but payment flow not tested → **UNACCEPTABLE**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **Given** All Priority ≥15 scenarios identified **When** tests executed **Then** all scenarios PASS
- [ ] **Given** Test plan **When** validation **Then** each test passes all 6 Usefulness Criteria
- [ ] **Given** Tests duplicate logic **When** review **Then** consolidate or remove duplication
- [ ] **Given** Scenario has Priority ≤14 **When** review **Then** skip test (manual testing sufficient)
- [ ] **Given** Test validates framework/library/database **When** review **Then** remove test (not OUR code)
