# Task Replan Algorithm

<!-- SCOPE: Task REPLAN algorithm ONLY. Contains IDEAL vs existing comparison, KEEP/UPDATE/OBSOLETE/CREATE operations, status constraints. -->
<!-- DO NOT add here: Task creation → ln-301-task-creator SKILL.md, coordinator logic → ln-300-task-coordinator SKILL.md -->

**MANDATORY READ:** Load `references/replan_algorithm_common.md` for Operations Matrix, Status Constraints, Edge Cases, Best Practices.

Detailed comparison logic for ln-302-task-replanner REPLAN MODE. This algorithm determines which operations (KEEP/UPDATE/OBSOLETE/CREATE) to perform when existing tasks are found for a Story.

## Overview

When a Story's requirements change and tasks already exist, x-task-coordinator compares the IDEAL task decomposition (from Phase 2) with existing tasks (from Linear) to determine the minimal set of operations needed.

**Key Principle**: The IDEAL plan from Phase 2 is the source of truth. Existing tasks are compared against this plan.

**Binding Rule**: For ideal tasks with no existing match, CREATE is the default. To skip CREATE, the artifact must be literally trivially small (a config line or constant — not a new file, class, module, or prompt document) AND verifiably delivered in an existing Done task's committed code. Vague exemptions ("implicitly covered," "embedded in code," "part of another task") are not sufficient without code evidence.

## Inputs

### Phase 2 Output: IDEAL Task Plan

Result from Story analysis (runs BEFORE checking existing tasks):

**Structure**:
- Task count: 1-4 (based on Story complexity)
- Task titles: Descriptive names (e.g., "Implement token generation endpoint")
- Task goals: Derived from Story AC
- Foundation-First ordering: Database → Repository → Service → API
- Estimate per task: 3-5 hours
- Guide links: From Story Technical Notes

**Example IDEAL Plan**:
```
IDEAL TASK PLAN (3 tasks, 12h total):
1. Implement token generation endpoint
   - Goal: Handle POST /auth/token with credentials
   - AC: AC1 (valid credentials), AC2 (invalid credentials)
   - Estimate: 4h

2. Add token validation middleware
   - Goal: Validate JWT tokens in protected routes
   - AC: AC3 (valid token), AC4 (expired token)
   - Estimate: 3h

3. Create token refresh logic
   - Goal: Implement token refresh mechanism
   - AC: AC5 (refresh with valid refresh token)
   - Estimate: 5h

Foundation-First order: ✓
Guide links: [JWT Best Practices](../../docs/guides/jwt-best-practices.md)
```

### Linear Data: Existing Tasks

From `list_issues(parentId=Story.id)`:

**Structure**:
- Task IDs: Linear issue IDs (e.g., "EP7_01", "EP7_02")
- Titles: Task titles
- Descriptions: Full 7 sections (Context, Implementation Plan, Technical Approach, AC, Components, Existing Code Impact, DoD)
- Status: Todo, In Progress, To Review, Done, Canceled

**Example Existing Tasks**:
```
EXISTING TASKS (3 found):
1. EP7_01: Implement token generation endpoint
   Status: Done
   Created: 2025-11-01
   AC: AC1, AC2

2. EP7_02: Validate JWT tokens
   Status: Todo
   Created: 2025-11-05
   AC: AC3 (missing AC4!)

3. EP7_03: Cache tokens in Redis
   Status: Todo
   Created: 2025-11-06
   AC: AC6 (caching requirement)
```

## Comparison Algorithm

### Step 1: Match by Goal

For EACH task in IDEAL plan:

1. **Extract goal** from IDEAL plan task title and description
2. **Search existing tasks** for similar goal:
   - Fuzzy match on titles (e.g., "token generation" matches "Implement token generation")
   - Check AC overlap (do they cover same Story AC?)
   - Look for key terms (e.g., "validation", "refresh", "generation")
3. **Result**:
   - If **match found** → Candidate for KEEP or UPDATE
   - If **no match** → Mark for CREATE

For EACH existing task:

1. **Extract goal** from existing task title and AC
2. **Search IDEAL plan** for similar goal
3. **Result**:
   - If **match found** → Candidate for KEEP or UPDATE
   - If **no match** → Mark for OBSOLETE

### Step 2: Determine Operations

> **See references/replan_algorithm_common.md for KEEP/UPDATE/OBSOLETE/CREATE criteria and Status Constraints.

**Task-specific examples:**

| Operation | Task Example | Result |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| KEEP | EP7_01 (AC1,AC2) matches IDEAL Task 1 (AC1,AC2), Status: Done | No action |
| UPDATE | EP7_02 (AC3 only) vs IDEAL Task 2 (AC3,AC4), Status: Todo | Add AC4, update Implementation Plan |
| OBSOLETE | EP7_03 (AC6 caching) not in IDEAL, AC6 removed | Cancel + comment |
| CREATE | IDEAL has "Email validation" (AC6), no existing task | Generate 7-section doc |

### Step 3: Handle Edge Cases

> **See references/replan_algorithm_common.md for generic edge cases (Split, Merge, Ambiguous, Done conflicts, In Progress OBSOLETE).

**Task-specific edge case:** AC Count Mismatch (AC reassigned between tasks)
```
IDEAL: Task 1 (AC1,AC2,AC3), Task 2 (AC4,AC5)
Existing: EP7_01 (AC1,AC2) Done, EP7_02 (AC3,AC4,AC5) Todo
→ WARNING: "AC3 reassigned. Manual code review needed."
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: AC Change (UPDATE)

**Story**: US001 OAuth Authentication
**Change**: AC4 "Handle expired tokens" ADDED to Story

**IDEAL Plan** (Phase 2):
```
1. Token generation endpoint (AC1, AC2)
2. Token validation middleware (AC3, AC4) ← AC4 NEW!
3. Token refresh logic (AC5)
```

**Existing Tasks**:
```
1. EP7_01: Token generation (AC1, AC2) - Done
2. EP7_02: Validate tokens (AC3 ONLY) - Todo
3. EP7_03: Token refresh (AC5) - In Progress
```

**Comparison**:
```
EP7_01 vs IDEAL Task 1:
- Goals match: ✓ (token generation)
- AC match: ✓ (AC1, AC2)
- Status: Done
→ KEEP

EP7_02 vs IDEAL Task 2:
- Goals match: ✓ (token validation)
- AC match: ✗ (AC3 only, AC4 missing)
- Status: Todo
→ UPDATE (add AC4)

EP7_03 vs IDEAL Task 3:
- Goals match: ✓ (token refresh)
- AC match: ✓ (AC5)
- Status: In Progress
→ KEEP (In Progress, don't interfere)
```

**Operations Summary**:
```
KEEP: 2 tasks (EP7_01 Done, EP7_03 In Progress)
UPDATE: 1 task (EP7_02 add AC4)
OBSOLETE: 0 tasks
CREATE: 0 tasks
```

**Diff for EP7_02 UPDATE**:
```diff
## Acceptance Criteria

- **Given** valid JWT token in Authorization header
  **When** request is made to protected route
  **Then** request proceeds with authenticated user context

+ **Given** expired JWT token in Authorization header
+   **When** request is made to protected route
+   **Then** return 401 Unauthorized with "Token expired" message
```

### Scenario 2: Feature Removed (OBSOLETE)

**Story**: US001 OAuth Authentication
**Change**: Caching requirement REMOVED from Story (AC6 deleted)

**IDEAL Plan** (Phase 2):
```
1. Token generation endpoint (AC1, AC2)
2. Token validation middleware (AC3, AC4)
3. Token refresh logic (AC5)
# NO caching task (AC6 removed)
```

**Existing Tasks**:
```
1. EP7_01: Token generation (AC1, AC2) - Done
2. EP7_02: Validate tokens (AC3, AC4) - Todo
3. EP7_03: Cache tokens in Redis (AC6) - Todo ← AC6 REMOVED!
```

**Comparison**:
```
EP7_01 → KEEP (matches IDEAL Task 1)
EP7_02 → KEEP (matches IDEAL Task 2)
EP7_03 → OBSOLETE (no matching goal in IDEAL plan, AC6 removed)
```

**Operations Summary**:
```
KEEP: 2 tasks
UPDATE: 0 tasks
OBSOLETE: 1 task (EP7_03 caching)
CREATE: 0 tasks
```

**Action for EP7_03**:
```
update_issue(
  id="EP7_03",
  state="Canceled"
)

Add comment:
"Task canceled due to Story replan. Caching requirement (AC6) removed from Story.
Original AC6: Cache JWT tokens in Redis with 1-hour TTL.
Reason: Simplified authentication flow, removed caching complexity."
```

### Scenario 3: New Feature Added (CREATE)

**Story**: US002 User Profile
**Change**: NEW AC4 "Upload avatar" ADDED to Story

**IDEAL Plan** (Phase 2):
```
1. Create profile endpoint (AC1)
2. Update profile endpoint (AC2, AC3)
3. Upload avatar (AC4) ← NEW!
```

**Existing Tasks**:
```
1. EP8_01: Create profile (AC1) - Done
2. EP8_02: Update profile (AC2, AC3) - In Progress
# NO avatar task
```

**Comparison**:
```
EP8_01 → KEEP (matches IDEAL Task 1, Done)
EP8_02 → KEEP (matches IDEAL Task 2, In Progress)
IDEAL Task 3 → CREATE (no existing task for avatar upload)
```

**Operations Summary**:
```
KEEP: 2 tasks
UPDATE: 0 tasks
OBSOLETE: 0 tasks
CREATE: 1 task (avatar upload)
```

**New Task EP8_03**:
```
Title: "EP8_03: Implement avatar upload for user profile"

Description: (7 sections)
- Context: Users need to upload profile pictures
- Implementation Plan: File upload, validation, storage, URL generation
- Technical Approach: Multipart form data, S3/local storage, image processing
- AC: AC4 from Story (upload, size limits, format validation)
- Affected Components: src/api/profile.ts, src/services/storage.ts
- Existing Code Impact: Add storage service, update profile model
- DoD: Upload works, validation enforced, images stored securely

Estimate: 4 hours
parentId: US002
```

### Scenario 4: Scope Reduction (Multiple OBSOLETE)

**Story**: US003 Payment Integration
**Change**: PayPal and Refund APIs REMOVED from scope (simplify to Stripe only)

**IDEAL Plan** (Phase 2):
```
1. Stripe integration (AC1, AC2)
2. Payment webhook (AC3)
# PayPal removed
# Refund API removed
```

**Existing Tasks**:
```
1. EP9_01: Stripe integration (AC1, AC2) - Todo
2. EP9_02: Payment webhook (AC3) - In Progress
3. EP9_03: PayPal integration (AC4) - Todo ← REMOVED!
4. EP9_04: Refund API (AC5) - Todo ← REMOVED!
```

**Comparison**:
```
EP9_01 → KEEP (matches IDEAL Task 1)
EP9_02 → KEEP (matches IDEAL Task 2, In Progress)
EP9_03 → OBSOLETE (PayPal removed)
EP9_04 → OBSOLETE (Refund removed)
```

**Operations Summary**:
```
KEEP: 2 tasks
UPDATE: 0 tasks
OBSOLETE: 2 tasks (EP9_03 PayPal, EP9_04 Refund)
CREATE: 0 tasks
```

**Warning**:
```
⚠️ EP9_02 (Payment webhook) is In Progress.
   Ensure webhook handler still works with reduced scope (Stripe only, no PayPal events).
   Manual review recommended.
```

### Scenario 5: Complex Reassignment

**Story**: US004 Search Functionality
**Change**: AC3 "Pagination" moved from "Search results" task to "Search API" task

**IDEAL Plan** (Phase 2):
```
1. Search API with pagination (AC1, AC2, AC3) ← AC3 moved here!
2. Search results display (AC4, AC5)
# AC3 was in Task 2, now in Task 1
```

**Existing Tasks**:
```
1. EP10_01: Search API (AC1, AC2) - Done
2. EP10_02: Search results (AC3, AC4, AC5) - Todo ← AC3 should move!
```

**Comparison**:
```
EP10_01 vs IDEAL Task 1:
- Goals match: ✓
- AC match: ✗ (AC3 missing, now required)
- Status: Done
→ KEEP (Done, don't update)
→ WARNING: AC3 pagination should be in API but implemented in results!

EP10_02 vs IDEAL Task 2:
- Goals match: ✓
- AC match: ✗ (AC3 should not be here)
- Status: Todo
→ UPDATE? (remove AC3, keep AC4/AC5)
→ WARNING: AC3 code may be in EP10_02, refactoring needed!
```

**Operations Summary**:
```
KEEP: 1 task (EP10_01 Done)
UPDATE: 1 task (EP10_02 remove AC3 reference)
CREATE: 1 task (NEW: Refactor pagination to API)
OBSOLETE: 0 tasks

WARNINGS:
- AC reassignment detected (AC3: results → API)
- EP10_01 is Done, cannot update
- Code refactoring required (move pagination logic)
- Manual intervention needed
```

**Recommended Action**:
```
Create NEW task:
EP10_03: "Refactor pagination from results to API"
- Goal: Move pagination logic from search results component to search API endpoint
- Reason: AC3 reassignment after EP10_01 completion
- Implementation: Extract pagination from EP10_02, integrate into API
- Testing: Ensure backward compatibility, update existing tests
- Estimate: 3 hours
```

## Task-Specific Best Practices

> **See references/replan_algorithm_common.md for universal Best Practices (Conservative Updates, Respect Status, Preserve History, Show Diffs, Warn Work Loss).

**Task-specific additions:**
- **Foundation-First Validation:** Ensure IDEAL plan respects Foundation-First order (DB → Repository → Service → API). Warn if replan changes order.
- **AC Reassignment:** When AC moves between tasks, code may be in wrong task. Create explicit refactoring tasks.
