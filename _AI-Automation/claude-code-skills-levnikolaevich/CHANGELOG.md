<!-- SCOPE: User-facing changes only. Max 5 bullets per entry. Focus: new capabilities, workflow changes, breaking changes. -->

## 2026-05-06

- **VPS Agent: hex-relay** — Telegram control-plane extracted from ln-030 references into standalone `agents/hex-relay/` package; Fastify+Zod typed routes, runProcess utility, `/health` build/runtime metadata, structured god-session error classification with deduped admin alerts
- **Per-user god-sessions** — systemd template instances `*-god@<telegram_user_id>.service` with bubblewrap-based agent-sandbox, per-project tmux sockets, per-user runtime under `/var/lib/${PROJECT_NAME}/users/<id>`; restart-on-update across all active instances
- **ln-030-vps-bootstrap skill (new)** — L3 standalone one-shot idempotent VPS bootstrap for Claude Code + Codex workloads; configurable `RELAY_HOOK_PORT`/`DISPATCH_COMMAND_NAME`, REPO_URL/REPO_REF git verification, VPS-local fleet registry under `/etc/agent-fleet`, register-telegram-commands automation for global + `all_private_chats` scope
- **Inbound enrichment** — local voice→text via ffmpeg + whisper.cpp (env-gated `RELAY_VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION`), durable queued message model with retry/abandon, `relay-bot v6` text-only DB schema with control lane and 24h-throttled task-poll notifications; `/tasks` provider polling every 15 min with handoff UI
- **MCP packages** — hex-line v1.27.1→v1.29.0 (Windows CRLF summary fix, generic-external-repo fallback scenarios, anchor-extraction de-flake), hex-graph v0.16.0→v0.19.0 (`audit_workspace` bounded preview with `limit`/`clone_member_limit`, gitignore-aware file discovery via `git ls-files`, full-rebuild `resetProjectGraph` on index_project), hex-ssh v1.6.1→v1.7.0 (per-tool timeout doc rows, regression guards)

## 2026-04-21

- **hex-line v1.17→v1.27** — PROTOCOL.md Response grammar (action-line + section/entry/detail prefixes), prose-noise cleanup (-37% output bytes), boundary-echo auto-strip preserves structural `}`/`)`/`]`/`});` delimiters, post-edit lexical brace-balance advisory, `range_checksum` on `replace_between`, new `warnings` field on `edit_file`
- **hex-graph v0.13.0→v0.15.0** — text-only MCP protocol (`content[0].text` grammar; `structuredContent`/`outputSchema` retired), expansion pointers carry canonical selectors (`symbol_id > workspace_qualified_name > qualified_name > name+file`), new `#quality` section exposing family/support tier/languages, 102/102 semantic tests
- **hex-ssh v1.4.2→v1.6.0** — per-tool timeout field scoping (exec-path tools expose `execTimeoutMs`, transfer tools expose `transferTimeoutMs`), per-call timeout overrides for connect/keepalive/exec/transfer
- **Response grammar migration** — hex-line graph-enrich output drops emoji prose (`⚠ Semantic impact:` → `#semantic_impact`, indented facts → `.` prefix, `⚠ N clone(s):` → `!clone_siblings count=N list=...`); MCP output families documented (structured vs text-grammar) in MCP_OUTPUT_CONTRACT_GUIDE and MCP_TOOL_DESIGN_GUIDE
- **Docs & CI** — five Claude hook events documented, plan-mode enforcement for mutating MCP tools, Monitor pattern docs, AGENTS docs unified with MCP result envelope, CI test suite repaired (hash collision test, 11 missing suites, deleted-runtime cleanup), Windows temp-path hint in coordinator CLI errors

## 2026-04-14

- **Advisor routing simplified** — external advisor routing now uses the active registry and self-review fallback. Cleanup across `agent_registry.json`, `agent_runner.mjs`, and the shared agent delegation/review/memory references.

## 2026-04-10

- **hex-line v1.12→v1.16** — progressive disclosure read (`edit_ready`/`verbosity`), line-ending preservation (LF/CRLF/CR), `allow_external` scope boundary, graph staleness auto-refresh, summary-first grep
- **hex-graph v0.8→v0.12** — summary-first output with `available_expansions`/provenance, expanded use-case API, SCIP module fix, 92/92 semantic tests
- **Artifact-first coordinators** — coordinators advance only from machine-readable artifacts; workers keep persisted runtime state and emit JSON summaries; new runtime contracts across all coordinator families
- **Planning runtime overhaul** — new/updated contracts for scope decomposition, epic/story/task planning, dependency and worker runtimes with coordinator summary contract and guard tests
- **Skill updates** — ln-200, ln-201, ln-210–ln-310, ln-840 refreshed with runtime alignment

## 2026-04-05

- **hex-line v1.12.0** — conservative conflict recovery (retry_edit/retry_edits/retry_plan), hook policy extraction, canonical output contracts for verify/changes
- **hex-graph v0.8.0** — output contract alignment (pruneEmpty, STATUS/ACTION constants, error mapping, DB busy handling), refactored platform and use-case API
- **hex-ssh v1.4.0** — remotePlatform parameter (auto/posix/windows), requirePosixRemotePath validation, transfer improvements
- **GitHub Actions Node.js 24** — upgraded checkout@v6, setup-node@v6, deploy-pages@v5

- **hex-graph v0.6.0** — new flow.mjs dataflow module with find_dataflows source/sink API, store expansion
- **CI fixes** — guards.mjs split path fix, hex-ssh sftp test isolation, hex-graph cross-platform workspace discovery, better-sqlite3 native binary rebuild on CI

## 2026-03-31

- **Advisor model selection cleanup** — removed hardcoded external advisor model flags from the agent registry. ln-011 post-install disables Conseca safety checker
- **hex-line search output cap** — block-aware 80K char limit prevents CC truncation on large search results; emits `OUTPUT_CAPPED` diagnostic with narrowing guidance
- **Agent review suggestion schema v2** — added `file`, `line_start`, `line_end`, `recommended_action` fields to all review schemas and prompt templates; relaxed read-only constraint to allow trivial fixes
- **model: claude-sonnet-4-6 in skills** — 32 SKILL.md files now declare explicit model; skills run on Sonnet 4.6 by default instead of inheriting parent model
- **hex-line hook safeExit + path filter** — writeSync-based flush before exit prevents output loss; path filter simplified to project-dir check (drops complex settings.json allowlist)

## 2026-03-30

- **hex-graph workspace-aware API** — tool parameters updated with explicit `path`, canonical selector rules, precision controls (`min_confidence`), and expanded language coverage (Python, C#, PHP with optional precise overlay)

## 2026-03-29

- **ln-310 quality-based refinement** — Codex iterative loop now exits by quality (MEDIUM/HIGH findings drive continuation), not just iteration count; added Architecture Gate, patience requirements, and risk mitigation criterion
- **Process cleanup enforcement** — mandatory `--verify-dead {pid}` after every Codex call in ln-310, ln-510, ln-813; runtime guard blocks self-check pass without process verification
- **Exit reason enum canonicalized** — CONVERGED/CONVERGED_LOW_IMPACT/MAX_ITER/ERROR/SKIPPED unified across workflow, runtime contract, status catalog, and smoke tests
- **Perspective-based refinement** — 5 iterations now use different review angles (Generic, Dry-Run, New Dev, Adversarial, Final Sweep) instead of repeating the same criteria; exits on 2 consecutive APPROVED
- **Guard integration tests** — new `guards.mjs` test validates all machine-enforced state transitions (exit_reason, processes_verified_dead)

## 2026-03-28

- **ln-015-hex-line-uninstaller** — standalone skill to remove hex-line hooks, output style, and settings from the system
- **hex-line auto-sync** — `setup_hooks` tool removed; hooks and output style now auto-sync on MCP server startup via content comparison

## 2026-03-27
- **Marketplace install docs** — updated README, plugin docs, and GitHub Pages site to use the current Claude Code marketplace flow (`/plugin marketplace add` + `/plugin install plugin@marketplace`) instead of unsupported `/plugin add`
- **Audit runtime unification** — 6XX coordinators and workers migrated to run-scoped artifacts, evaluation runtime CLIs, and JSON summary contract with `summaryArtifactPath`
- **Runtime status catalog** — canonical status sets codified across active runtime contracts (story-gate, optimization, evaluation, environment)
- **Worker independence cleanup** — removed 36 coordinator-aware DoD references, fixed 3 false positives in review-skills checks (R12/R13/R16)

## 2026-03-26
- **State platform runtime** — shared coordinator runtime now enforces manifest, state, checkpoints, history, active-pointer, and status schemas across stateful skill families
- **Planning and environment migration** — ln-010, ln-220, and ln-300 now run on identifier-scoped runtimes with pause/resume, replay, and standalone worker summaries
- **Coordinator family alignment** — ln-310, ln-400, ln-500, ln-810, and ln-1000 now follow the same run-scoped runtime discipline and normalized CLI/status contracts
- **Review and contract hardening** — ln-162 and `review-skills` now catch standalone-worker drift, reverse coupling, and non-run-scoped runtime artifacts
- **Docs and skill compression** — planning, environment, and pipeline skills/docs were rewritten into shorter runtime-first contracts with updated public docs and site pages

## 2026-03-25
- **ln-010 npx cache probe** — hex package version detection via npx cache scan instead of `npm outdated -g`; setup_hooks called unconditionally in Phase 3c verification
- **ln-014 auto-fix** — Phase 5b auto-fixes missing Compact Instructions and MCP Tool Preferences sections in instruction files
