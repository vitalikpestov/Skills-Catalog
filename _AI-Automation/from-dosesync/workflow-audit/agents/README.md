# Workflow Audit Skill

A systematic approach to discovering, tracing, evaluating, and verifying UI workflows in SwiftUI applications.

> **Note:** Concrete examples in this file (sheet enum names, file paths, "Results Summary" counts) reference a real workflow-audit run on the Stuffolio codebase. They are illustrative — the *methodology* (5 layers, issue categories, design principles, cautionary note) is reusable; the specific projects/files/counts are not. A full sample scan lives in `../examples/sample-stuffolio-scan/`.

## Overview

The Workflow Audit Skill uses a 5-layer approach to identify workflow issues:

| Layer | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Layer 1: Pattern Discovery** | Find all UI entry points | Entry point inventory |
| **Layer 2: Flow Tracing** | Trace critical paths in depth | Detailed flow traces |
| **Layer 3: Issue Detection** | Categorize issues across codebase | Issue catalog |
| **Layer 4: Semantic Evaluation** | Evaluate from user perspective | UX impact analysis |
| **Layer 5: Data Wiring** | Verify features use real data | Data integrity report |

## Quick Start

### 1. Run Layer 1 Discovery
```bash
# Find promotion cards
grep -r "PromotionCard\s*(" Sources/ --include="*.swift"

# Find sheet triggers
grep -r "activeSheet = \." Sources/ --include="*.swift"

# Find navigation
grep -r "selectedSection = \." Sources/ --include="*.swift"

# Find context menus
grep -r "\.contextMenu" Sources/ --include="*.swift"
```

### 2. Check Layer 3 Automated Tests (14 checks)
```bash
# Sheet coverage: all enum cases should have handlers
# Compare DashboardSheetType cases vs sheetContent(for:) handlers

# Orphan check: views should be instantiated somewhere
# grep for "struct XxxView: View" then verify usage

# Notification type-safety (Check 10b): cross-reference userInfo keys
# across senders/receivers for type mismatches

# Simulated delay (Check 13): Task.sleep/asyncAfter before hardcoded data
```

### 3. Review Outputs
- `layer1-inventory.yaml` - All entry points cataloged
- `layer2-traces/` - Detailed flow traces
- `layer3-results.yaml` - Categorized issues
- `layer4-semantic-evaluation.md` - User impact analysis
- `layer5-data-wiring.yaml` - Data integrity audit

## Issue Categories

| Category | Severity | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Dead End | 🔴 CRITICAL | Entry point leads nowhere |
| Wrong Destination | 🔴 CRITICAL | Entry point leads to wrong place |
| Mock Data | 🔴 CRITICAL | Fake data displayed as real |
| Incomplete Navigation | 🟠 HIGH | User must scroll/search after landing |
| Missing Auto-Activation | 🟠 HIGH | Expected mode/state not set |
| Unwired Data | 🟠 HIGH | Real data exists but isn't used |
| Platform Parity Gap | 🟠 HIGH | Feature works on iOS but not macOS |
| Promise-Scope Mismatch | 🟠 HIGH | Specific CTA opens generic/broad destination |
| Buried Primary Action | 🟠 HIGH | Primary button hidden below scroll fold |
| Dismiss Trap | 🟠 HIGH | Only visible action is Cancel, no forward path |
| Context Dropping | 🟠 HIGH | Navigation path loses item context between platforms |
| Notification Nav Fragility | 🟠 HIGH | Untyped NotificationCenter dict for navigation |
| Sheet Presentation Asymmetry | 🟠 HIGH | Different mechanisms per platform for same feature |
| Two-Step Flow | 🟡 MEDIUM | Intermediate selection required |
| Missing Feedback | 🟡 MEDIUM | No confirmation of success |
| Gesture-Only Action | 🟡 MEDIUM | Feature only accessible via swipe/long-press |
| Loading State Trap | 🟡 MEDIUM | Spinner with no cancel/timeout/escape |
| Stale Navigation Context | 🟡 MEDIUM | Cached context with no clearing mechanism |
| Inconsistent Pattern | 🟢 LOW | Same feature accessed differently |
| Orphaned Code | 🟢 LOW | Feature exists but no entry point |

## Pattern Library

### Good Patterns

**Sheet-based feature access:**
```swift
// ✅ Good - immediate access
action: { activeSheet = .stuffScout }
```

**Item picker for context-dependent features:**
```swift
// ✅ Good - provides necessary context
case .appleCareTracking:
    AppleCareTrackingSheet(
        appleProducts: appleProductsWithoutAppleCare,
        onItemSelected: { item in /* show feature */ }
    )
```

### Problematic Patterns

**Section navigation for feature discovery:**
```swift
// ❌ Bad - user lands at section top, not feature
action: { selectedSection = .tools }
```

**Navigation without state setup:**
```swift
// ❌ Bad - expected mode not activated
action: { selectedSection = .myProducts }
// Should also set: isSelectMode = true
```

**Primary action buried in ScrollView:**
```swift
// ❌ Bad - user must scroll past tall content to find Continue
ScrollView {
    VStack {
        photos           // visible
        sourceOptions    // 5-7 tall cards push button off screen
        Button("Continue") { ... }
            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
    }
}

// ✅ Good - button pinned outside ScrollView
VStack(spacing: 0) {
    ScrollView {
        VStack { photos; sourceOptions }
    }
    Divider()
    Button("Continue") { ... }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
        .padding()
}
```

## Usage in Other Projects

This skill can be adapted to any SwiftUI project:

1. **Identify entry point patterns** - What UI elements trigger navigation/sheets?
2. **Create pattern library** - Regex patterns for your project's conventions
3. **Run Layer 1 discovery** - Catalog all entry points
4. **Flag suspicious patterns** - Navigation without deep link, missing state setup
5. **Trace critical flows** - Focus on user-facing features
6. **Evaluate user impact** - Does the workflow help users achieve their goals?

## Design Principles

### 1. Honor the Promise
> When a button/card says "Do X", tapping it should DO X.
> Not "go somewhere you might find X."

### 2. Context-Aware Shortcuts
> If user's context implies a specific item, skip pickers.
> One damaged item → Open repair advisor for that item.

### 3. State Preservation
> When navigating to a feature, set up the expected state.
> "Bulk Actions" → Enter Select mode automatically.

### 4. Consistent Access Patterns
> Same feature should be accessed the same way everywhere.
> Standardize on sheet pattern for feature discovery.

### 5. Data Integrity
> Never show mock/hardcoded data when real user data exists.
> If the model tracks it, the feature should use it.

### 6. Primary Action Visibility
> The primary action must be visible without scrolling after the user completes the key interaction.
> Pin Save/Continue/Done buttons outside ScrollView or in toolbar. Never bury them below tall content.

### 7. Escape Hatch
> Every view must have a visible way to go forward OR back. Cancel alone is not enough after user completes a step.
> If dismissing would lose work, provide both Cancel and a forward action.

### 8. Gesture Discoverability
> Every action available via gesture (swipe, long-press) should also be accessible via a visible button or menu.
> Gestures are shortcuts, not the only path.

## Maintenance

Re-run this audit when:
- Adding new promotion cards or feature discovery UI
- Adding new sections or navigation destinations
- Refactoring sheet management
- User reports "I can't find X" issues

## Cautionary Note: AI-Powered Audit Plugins

**Plugins like `workflow-audit` are tools, not oracles.**

These plugins systematically scan your codebase using pattern matching and heuristics. They can surface real issues you'd miss manually — but they have inherent limitations:

**What they're good at:**
- Finding structural inconsistencies (orphaned code, missing handlers, type mismatches)
- Catching patterns that compile but fail silently at runtime
- Enforcing consistency across platforms (iOS vs macOS parity)
- Providing a repeatable, systematic checklist

**What they can miss:**
- Business logic correctness — a plugin can verify a button exists, not that it does the right thing
- User experience nuance — "buried" is a judgment call that depends on content height, screen size, and context
- False positives — code flagged as "orphaned" may be intentionally retained for future use
- False negatives — novel bug patterns not covered by existing checks won't be detected

**How to use them responsibly:**
- Treat findings as leads to investigate, not verdicts to act on blindly
- Verify critical findings manually before committing fixes
- Expect the plugin to evolve — today's 14 checks won't catch tomorrow's new patterns
- Don't assume a clean audit means zero issues; it means zero *known-pattern* issues
- Review the skill's detection patterns periodically to understand what it actually checks vs what you assume it checks

**Bottom line:** An audit plugin replaces neither testing nor human review. It's a force multiplier for the reviewer, not a replacement.
